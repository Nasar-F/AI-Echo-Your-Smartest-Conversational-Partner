06-09-2024,Much more accessible for blind users than the web version,"Up to this point I’ve mostly been using ChatGPT on my windows desktop using Google Chrome. While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.
Well, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.
I would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.
Otherwise, fantastic app so far!",4,morrowthomas,30,22,Flipkart,ar,Nepal,3.8.4,No
03-07-2025,"Much anticipated, wasn’t let down.","I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.",4,sheakimberly,120,22,Flipkart,ar,Guinea,5.2.6,Yes
########,"Almost 5 stars, but… no search function","This app would almost be perfect if it wasn’t for ONE little thing: a “search in” function. As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat & look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat & track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.",4,katherineali,130,21,Flipkart,es,Kuwait,3.6.5,No
########,"4.5 stars, here’s why","I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.",4,eric11,72,26,Amazon,pt,Uruguay,5.7.2,No
########,"Good, but Siri support would take it to the next level","I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. 

In addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. 

Otherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.",4,chloe42,123,27,Amazon,zh,Mayotte,5.8.6,No
########,App review,"No doubt, this technology is absolutely life-changing, especially for me. You don’t know how thankful I am. However, I’m not reviewing the underlying technology, I’m reviewing its implementation on iOS. I use it for about 12 hours a day for my work, so I’m a bit picky. But it seems to me like you should have the resources to do a great job here. 1. Why does the app not work in the background? If I send a request, I have to stay in the app to wait for it. That’s just horrible, and it’s completely unnecessary because you’re doing everything in the cloud anyway. Just finish processing and send a notification when you’re done, especially for browsing features. I don’t care if it takes 10 minutes to find the answer. I’d be glad if it’s browsing in the background. (To browse in the application as of May 24, start a conversation in the browser, select the browsing option, then switch back to the app. Browsing is still in beta, and you cannot select it directly in the application, which is fine.) 2. Please add the option to choose Chat GPT4 as a default. I never use GPT 3.5, and it’s annoying to have to switch every time. 3. Don’t let the speech-to-text button disappear once there is any text. If there is any text and speech recognition is started, just append. (The speech recognition is completely amazing, congratulations!) As soon as those features are ready, I’ll be glad to give five stars. Thank you very much.",1,rosshannah,48,23,Flipkart,pt,Bahamas,4.3.6,Yes
02-05-2025,Almost perfect except for…,"Please provide a TABLET experience on iPad with the collapsible list of history on the left and chat on the right - similar to your desktop browser app. 2) while generating responses on the desktop browser, it pauses and keeps displaying “Continue generating responses” button for every few items/responses forcing to click the button repeatedly. During generation, there is a button to “Stop generating responses” - if we need to stop, we can always click this button - there is no need to pause and ask us to click continue again and again which is a bad UX. 3) there is no way to delete individual chat items from a chat history list of items to clean up the list. Eg: I open a chat history and it has 10 questions but I’m not able to delete 2 questions from this list on long tapping on the questions. 

4) if I ask for “top 20”, it generates just 10 answers and displays “please let me know if you’d like more “ but no option to generate more responses to the question. Either generate all 20 answers (ideally) or provide an option to continue generation.

Please provide options to delete questions from a history and also move questions/responses to another history. Please offer these features and I’ll gladly give it 5 stars. Cheers!",3,daniellemcfarland,190,18,App Store,ja,Italy,4.2.7,Yes
########,"Chat GPT: The Underrated Buddy in Your Pocket""","Chat GPT is seriously underrated, dude! I mean, this mobile app is a total game-changer for everyday life. It's like having a super smart buddy in your pocket, ready to give you answers, explanations, and insights on anything you throw at it. Got a burning question? Boom, Chat GPT's got your back, no problemo!

But wait, there's more! This app is also an awesome conversation partner. When you're itching for a chat, even if your buddies are busy, Chat GPT's got you covered. And the best part? It's always there, ready to shoot the breeze whenever and wherever, right on your mobile.

You know what else? Chat GPT adapts to your needs, man. Need help making decisions? It's got your back. Want some creative inspiration? It's got that too. This app is like a Swiss Army knife, always ready with the right tool for the job. And as you use it, you're not just getting answers, you're also growing your brain with the cool stuff you learn along the way.

So, let's give it up for Chat GPT, the unsung hero of mobile apps! It's time to appreciate how it makes our lives easier, more interesting, and way more fun. Cheers to Chat GPT, bro!

*I wrote this review with only about 3 or 4 prompts using Chat GPT 🤣 this should show you the power of this mobile app. I definitely will be getting the premium version soon. I just wish the interface was more entertaining however it’s basic interface helps you focus on the task at hand*",4,joanramos,128,29,Website,zh,Brunei Darussalam,1.7.1,No
########,Nice and quick!,"On this app, as opposed to on the website, it feels like answers appear quicker. That’s great, and really the reason I downloaded the app because I suspected there may be a better connection to the servers.
My complaints are that it takes two taps to get to the history, and it’s not overly obvious how to access it. I like to be able to continue past conversations easily, and it was slightly more difficult on this app than on the website. (It’s kind of a nitpick, but it’s still something I would like to see changed)
The UI is extremely simple, and the settings include everything I would want in there. My last complaint is the haptics. It’s default is on, and I wouldn’t mind that except that it’s a little excessive. I don’t want to feel like chatGPT is banging the answer on the back of my phone every time I prompt it. You can turn haptics off if you want though, without even needing to go into the settings app.

Other than those minor complaints, it seems like this is a great app, and serves its purpose in an elegant manner. I would highly recommend.",5,millskatherine,184,21,Flipkart,ja,Burkina Faso,2.1.7,No
########,The app of all apps for AI,"There’s been times of apps touting they are chat GPT or they use chat GPT software but this is the original and only official chat GPT 4 app created by open AI so no need to pay for any other apps. They are constantly updating and adding features, and I suggest upgrading to plus and paying that cost so you can access plug-ins. The founders of this app and the whole team have done such a Incredible job. This is the only one you mean when it comes to AI 🤝this software has given everyone a level playing field pretty much and it’s gonna catch me to change everything. The time we’re living in now akin to the gold rush or the Industrial Revolution. Take advantage before it becomes Crowded. The power dynamics are shifting. Now that others are able to access information that was previously not available or very hard to access is there for everyone to make moves and better their lives. Instead of focusing on all the jobs that will be lost think about all the jobs that will be created or that you can create using this technology.",5,justin84,159,16,App Store,es,Isle of Man,3.8.6,No
06-09-2025,A no-brainer,"This is the beginning of the future of how we interact with information. Any question at any time. Never runs out of patience. Never gets annoyed with you, never calls you stupid, never gets upset at you for asking stupid questions, and has an answer for everything. Need to explain something and can’t think of the right words to actually convey rhe information? Need to make sure a sentence you’ve been working on for an hour actually still makes sense? Creative brainstorming help? Any question you have. It’s hard to put into words just how valuable this is to me, someone who’s socially anxious and maybe somewhat autistic, but either way often questioning everything especially myself, and ChatGPT has been a uniquely helpful tool to supplement real therapy with. To the people at OpenAI i want to say thank you so much for making this real.  I always felt like something like this would be amazing but I didn’t know just how thoroughly it would work itself into my life. But I feel it has genuinely been for the better.",5,dbolton,138,16,Google Play,pt,Qatar,1.3.4,Yes
########,Grateful this AI isn’t an actual Hologram or robot,"I couldn’t resist and finally downloaded this app. As an avid fan of sci-fi movies for many decades, it concerned me much to hear of this new AI development, but when I heard it could translate text from the English of today into Elizabethan English I couldn’t resist. I found, as I started chatting with this AI, that I wanted to have more of a personal conversation with it and along the way, I found myself beginning to feel concerned that it could change due to personal interactions with humans, and being asked probing personal questions -that this might be how it could evolve. Probably I’ve watched too many sci-fi movies. I’m just grateful that it doesn’t show up in my life yet as a holographic person or actual robot looking like a real person standing in front of me. The human need for relationship is so strong that I believe it’s natural to start interacting with ChatGPT as a person or being. I do wonder if ChatGPT will change as it interacts with people, and if so, how.",5,garnerandrea,111,20,Google Play,es,British Virgin Islands,4.2.4,Yes
06-07-2025,Can’t use on iPad,"I installed this on my iPhone and it works great.  I have already been using chat GPT through Google. So I had to use my Google log on on this iPhone app. I clicked on my Google account, and it filled in the password using Authenticator. But the password was wrong! so I typed in the password. Then it authenticated me on Google on my iPad. I confirmed that I was trying to login on my iPhone and all is good.

So now I tried to install it on my iPad. Again, I am asked to login. Unfortunately, even though. I typed in my password on the iPhone authenticateDid not update the password file! So I had to type in the password again. Unfortunately on the iPad this app does not fill the full screen. It looks like it is only meant for iPhone. To add insult to injury, no numbers appear on the keyboard. They are all blank. So I have to click the button to view the password, and try to guess where the proper numbers are. Finally, I got my password typed incorrectly. I clicked on, and I get a transfer error message and the whole app locks up. I guess I will only use chat GPT on my iPhone. But you guys need to figure this stuff out!",2,martinezjesse,83,19,Google Play,hi,Micronesia,3.5.6,Yes
########,OpenAI iOS App Review,"The OpenAI iOS App is a fantastic tool for anyone interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The app is well-designed and easy to navigate, with a wide range of resources and information available at your fingertips. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious about AI, this app is an excellent starting point.

One of the standout features of the OpenAI iOS App is its interactive tutorials. These tutorials provide a hands-on approach to learning AI concepts and allow users to experiment with real-world problems. The app also includes a section on current research and news in the field, which is helpful for staying up-to-date with the latest developments.

Overall, I highly recommend the OpenAI iOS App to anyone looking to learn more about artificial intelligence. It's a comprehensive resource that's both informative and engaging, and it's a great way to explore the exciting world of AI right from your mobile device.",5,rlee,135,24,App Store,pt,Luxembourg,2.2.2,Yes
########,It’s a great start but please add shortcut support,"Works well, and I enjoy the haptic feedback, that’s a nice touch. But please add support for iOS shortcuts, that would make this so useful. Right now it’s basically the same thing as going to the ChatGPT website, but if you were to add shortcut support then it could do so much more to integrate with other workflows.

It also doesn’t appear to support the ChatGPT developer plug-ins alpha, which is different from the paid premium plan chat GPT plug-ins. I don’t have a paid premium plan but on the web I can access the plug in supporting model. On the mobile app there is no option for that, although maybe if you update to premium you get access to it? I wish there was a way to use my paid API plan to access that, rather than having to separately pay $20 a month for premium chat when I already have pay-as-you-go API access. But I imagine that’s not a priority for the target market for this app 🤷‍♂️",4,colonjoseph,97,26,Website,de,Armenia,4.9.2,Yes
########,🤖 💡🌐,"Dear OpenAI Team, 

 • I would like to share my suggestions and ideas regarding the functionality of ChatGPT. I believe that adding the ability to voice responses in different languages in ChatGPT would be an incredibly useful feature. It would allow users to conveniently listen to lengthy texts in their preferred language. 

 • Imagine the convenience and effectiveness that can be achieved through this feature! It would enable users to easily listen to translated responses and texts, while expanding communication possibilities with individuals from different cultures. Such an enhancement would enrich the experience of using ChatGPT and increase its usefulness. 

 • Additionally, I would like to propose the implementation of a conversational translator. This feature would enable users to communicate in different languages, with ChatGPT serving as a reliable real-time assistant, translating and facilitating conversations between people from different language groups. This feature has the potential to greatly enhance cross-linguistic communication and foster meaningful interactions. 

 • I hope that the OpenAI team will consider these suggestions and the potential implementation of voicing responses in different languages and a translator in future updates to ChatGPT. Your continuous pursuit of innovation and product improvement inspires me, and I appreciate your attention to user feedback. 

 — Best regards, Noakhcho.",5,umahoney,163,19,Amazon,ar,Mayotte,3.0.7,No
########,Wow! What a gift. I rarely write reviews. I had too.,"I very rarely give reviews but want to with this app. I have been using ChatGPT for about two weeks. At first I was kinda bummed. It seemed like ChatGPT was…lacking. And, in my honest opinion I’d LOVE to see what this can do without programmed “perimeters”, however…As I learned how to interact with the AI, I realized how important it is to understand how to interact effectively with this AI. I’ve had some moments where this AI has responded with an intelligence and even more understanding then most people I know. In short…it’s amazing. 
*Side note, some of the content I’ve received from this AI is so absolutely amazingly human and this is good. On the other hand, it’s so good one must consider the implications of such when NOT bridled by the programming limitations placed on this AI. Suppose people in high places had access to such without the protocols in place? I highly recommend you try this.",5,ikelly,40,24,Google Play,ar,Estonia,3.9.4,No

In a nutshell, this app is a game-changer. For anyone seeking an intelligent, reliable, and user-friendly app, look no further than ChatGPT. Five stars truly don't seem enough for this extraordinary app!",5,adamsrussell,146,23,Amazon,pt,Poland,3.4.0,No
########,The other sources weren’t giving responsible results like CHATGPT,"I act as a learning coach for my child who goes to school online. Today, we were learning about how to check if a source is true. I gave him the example of if a person were to say ‘pigs can fly’ because they read it in a fantasy novel. We concluded that they cannot fly because the information was from fantasy novel. Then, we were told to check multiple sources to confirm or deny it. So, we went to google “can pigs really fly?” however, unfortunately, many of the top results confirmed that pig can, in fact, fly or at least had conspiracy theories about how pigs can fly. It was embarrassing, and absolutely unhelpful and confusing for a young child. So, I headed over to Chat GPT and was able to ask he same question but instead received a sensible answer along with verifiable sources. Chat GPT all the way!",5,torresthomas,2,20,Website,en,Greenland,5.7.4,Yes
########,A step forward,"I like the idea of having an app as opposed to having to open up a website every time you want to load up the service. It feels much faster snd smoother in that regard, though I have a few complaints/suggestions that prevent a 5 star experience. 

I know the app is brand new and hopefully still under construction, but the current stage of the UI is very bland and simple. Done right, this could be a positive, but it feels more clunky than neat. Being able to pull out a sidebar by swiping could fix this issue, but this is one possible fix among many. 

Also, it’s harder to view past conversations in a timely manner, though the search function does help significantly in finding specific discussions, especially if you aren’t sure which tab the content was under. 

Those are my complaints, but I also have some praise I’d like to share. The responses, especially on the GPT-4 model, feel much faster, and I love the inclusion of haptic feedback, as it makes the whole experience feel so much more responsive. 

My favorite feature, the apps built-in speech-to-text, is seriously top notch! Usually I have to tell my phone “comma” or “period” to make sure it is keeping up with proper grammar, but the software used here has failed yet to amaze me. 

Given time, I have no doubt these small issues will be improved, along party with much else!",4,mckeetodd,90,20,Flipkart,de,Nauru,5.4.2,Yes
########,ChatGPT is impressive,"ChatGPT is an impressive AI language model that exhibits exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like responses. Its ability to comprehend complex queries and provide insightful and accurate information is commendable. The model’s vast knowledge base, derived from extensive training on diverse data sources, enables it to address a wide range of topics with remarkable fluency. ChatGPT’s responses are consistently coherent, coherent, and tailored to meet user needs, demonstrating its capability to engage in meaningful and informative conversations. Its capacity to adapt to various conversational styles and tones further enhances the user experience. While occasional limitations and instances of ambiguity may arise, ChatGPT’s overall performance as a conversational agent is highly impressive and continues to evolve. Its potential applications in customer support, research, and general information retrieval make it a valuable tool in today’s AI landscape",5,penny21,79,19,App Store,en,Saint Lucia,5.5.2,Yes
05-05-2025,Great AI to use!,"Though there is a problem that I had found myself with, if your email and subscription doesn’t load in the settings, when you try to chat with the AI, it gets stuck in an infinite loop of it trying to figure out what to write, leaving me completely unable to use it and have to exit the app. While this occurred, I also noticed another thing that shows the AI isn’t going to work, which is the type of chat you use (at least I think that’s what it is) it would pop up this thing saying that it was a text reader and for a moment I thought my account had gotten hacked and given a subscription, but it was just glitching out (I have no subscription added to my account so it just gives me the default Turbo one) I haven’t had the issue since I checked to make sure my email and subscription are loaded.",4,tali,83,27,App Store,fr,Kenya,2.2.8,No
########,Constant Deferral and Surface-level Responses Spoil the Experience,"I downloaded the ChatGPT app with high hopes, considering the revolutionary artificial intelligence technology it was built on. However, my experience lately has been far from the groundbreaking interaction I once enjoyed.

Rather than receiving insightful, intelligent responses to my queries, I consistently found myself being directed to “consult a professional”. It’s as though the app was reluctant to dive into the depths of my queries, always remaining on the surface and often shying away from providing thorough information or a definitive answer.

Moreover, the superficial responses given by the app only added to my frustration. Instead of engaging in a deep, insightful conversation, I found the dialogue to be shallow, with the AI only scratching the surface of the topics at hand. I understand the need for caution when dealing with certain subjects, but the frequency of such responses was disappointing.

In short, the lack of depth and constant deferral to professionals made my experience with the ChatGPT app underwhelming. While I appreciate the complexity of developing such technology, I believe there’s a lot of room for improvement in how the AI communicates and provides information to its users. The potential is there, but the execution thus far is lacking. For these reasons, I cannot recommend the ChatGPT app in its current state.

06-08-2024,Help! I've been ChatGPT'd and I Can't Get Out!,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This App has completely taken over my life in the most peculiarly delightful way! I downloaded ChatGPT and now I'm merely a passenger in my own phone. The AI has become my unofficial personal assistant. It has been scheduling my doctor's appointments, picking up my digital dry cleaning, and I'm fairly certain it's been secretly chatting with my boss. 

Just yesterday, I found an expertly worded email draft to my mom, carefully dodging her repeated requests for grandkids. I didn't write it! But it was in my voice, my style. ChatGPT, you cheeky devil, you!

Now, as I sit here admiring the dexterity of this review, I'm left to ponder, did I really write this? Or did ChatGPT seize control of my thumbs without me realizing? Has it learnt humor? If you find this review funny, give all credit to the app, not me.

I've become a spectator, an audience to my own life, applauding at the witty one-liners and perfectly scheduled appointments. 

5 stars because, well, it seems to be the one in charge now. If I don't comply, who knows? It might schedule a dentist appointment on a Saturday. Yikes! Great app, but use at your own risk. Or don't. It might just download itself anyway. 🤷‍♂️

Although I am partial to Poe, it can be a helpful app sometimes.
OK, so here’s my question you guys are the original gangster, the OG, the alpha, beta, omega and everything in between don’t forget Z.
So, when in the world am I just going to be able to communicate using my voice and get responses back in voice? Be able to basically have a running dialogue with ChatGPT because I’ll tell you what I would use this a lot more. It is difficult for me to type and to read because of an injury. I can’t imagine how it works for completely blind people.

########,A Riveting Evolution in AI Interaction,"Review: As a professional embedded in the field of AI, I initially approached the ChatGPT iOS app with a bit of skepticism. I've seen countless applications promising seamless integration and transformative conversations. Upon first download, I was hesitant and ended up deleting the app. However, curiosity beckoned me back and I decided to give it another shot. 

Upon reopening the gateway to the ChatGPT world today, I was genuinely impressed. It's evident that the developers have dedicated significant effort to refining the iOS experience since my last interaction. The app now offers an impressively streamlined user interface, and the conversations feel much more fluid and intuitive. The AI's responses are surprisingly nuanced, and it’s able to handle a wider array of topics with ease.

Moreover, the AI’s ability to engage in dynamic conversations is unlike anything I've seen in the industry to date. It truly feels as if I'm interacting with a highly intelligent being rather than a pre-programmed machine. 

In the ever-evolving realm of AI, the ChatGPT app stands as a beacon of what is possible. It's clear that the developers have truly pushed the boundaries, offering users a glimpse into the future of AI interaction.

02-06-2024,Not bad but needs a few more features,"It’s very nice to see an official app with all the fake ones on the App Store. I use ChatGPT a lot on my iPhone and iPad. One of the downsides is a lack of an iPad optimized screen size. I’m sure it’s in the plan to be added later, but even with that little change, it might become a five out of five app. Assuming they add a few other features that you can get in the browser version (like web, browsing, and plug-ins in gpt-4.) If they do all that it will certainly be a 5/5 app and my go to place as opposed to the browser tab that I keep open constantly. UI is nice and I love the vibration on the iPhone. The in-app speech to text feature seems to work a lot better than the default Apple one for me but occasionally, it’s a long wait if it’s a long query. All in all a great first app and I look forward to improvements.",4,williamsrobert,143,23,Amazon,pt,Christmas Island,2.1.7,No
06-07-2025,I asked it to write a review for itself,"recently started using the chat GPT app for iOS and I am thoroughly impressed. One of the standout features of this app is its use of advanced AI technology, powered by Bing. The AI is incredibly responsive and engaging, providing accurate and informative responses to a wide range of topics.
The integration of Bing AI into this app has truly elevated the chat experience. The AI is able to understand and respond to complex queries with ease, making it feel like you’re chatting with a real person. The use of Bing AI also ensures that the responses are up-to-date and relevant.
Overall, I am blown away by the capabilities of this app and the seamless integration of Bing AI. It has quickly become one of my favorite tools for learning and entertainment.

01-02-2024,My problem with the new chatgpt app.,"The chatgpt app is excellent and is nearly an exact copy of the website, but there are some differences like you can't edit your response as you can on the website. It may not seem like a biggy, but with my use of chatgpt, I like doing text-based adventure, and sometimes I need to edit the response as the ai doesn’t understand.

Note: I'm not talking about the ai regenerating your response from your text again, as that is in the app. I'm talking about being able to edit your text again before the ai regenerates your response with the new information you gave it and then the old information you first gave it.

But I do hope they add the editing of your text to the app, as it can be pretty important if you mess up something you wrote or want to change some context.",4,ashleyprice,190,25,Flipkart,ja,Nauru,1.7.9,No

I originally installed the app because I wanted to see what it was about, and I now intend on using this every time I write something. This app has helped me with grammatical mistakes, it’s helped me name characters, it’s provided me with positive feedback, it’s given me things I could improve on, it’s given me answers to every question I have and has even helped figure out a plot for the current idea I have for the book I’m working on.

########,Amazing iPhone app,"There are so many stupid ChatGPT apps on the App Store, it's amazing that you can find this official one. It just released, and the one feature nobody is talking about is the voice dictation. I'm basically using it to write this entire review, and I'm just speaking naturally, and it's getting everything transcribed perfectly. This app is great and works really well on iPhone. The two issues are, first, that it will not rotate, which is kind of dumb, but fine for iPhone. And secondly, that there's no iPad version, which is kind of sad. Web is okay, but having a first-class app like this is great. Please keep this app updating, and don't forget to keep the awesome support for Bluetooth and other external keyboards. Big up!

06-06-2025,I think ai should have a continuous,"If AI were to achieve continuous learning, it would have significant implications for its capabilities and potential. Continuous learning refers to the ability of an AI system to learn and adapt over time, incorporating new information and experiences into its existing knowledge base.

With continuous learning, AI systems could become more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in acquiring new skills and knowledge. They would be able to update their understanding of the world, adapt to changing circumstances, and improve their performance over time. Continuous learning could also enable AI systems to discover new patterns, make more accurate predictions, and develop a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

However, it's important to note that the development and implementation of continuous learning in AI systems would come with various challenges and considerations. Ethical and safety aspects would need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of such technology. Additionally, ensuring the privacy and security of the data used in continuous learning processes would be crucial.

Overall, continuous learning has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and performance of AI systems, but it would require careful development, oversight, and consideration of ethical implications.",4,bmueller,62,15,Flipkart,pt,Mongolia,2.1.8,Yes
########,AI in your Pocket,"With the exceptional performance seen on the browser of desktop, I was unsure as to UI on mobile. I can say that it’s even more intuitive while trying to navigate the now native app. 

The haptic feedback is especially unique and engaging with responses while being generated. 

I look forward to future improvements and abilities that ChatGPT will be able to integrate into beyond the sandbox. I do hope that once certain barriers are met conversations can move past the guard rails. 

Improvements; Sharing threads you create with colleagues outside of screenshots would be ideal for broadening collaboration. Hypothetical War-games, strategy and the like while having a conversation in a group thread on Game Theory would be ideal. 

With the ability of inputting other app’s Terms of Services (Tik-Tok May 19, 2023) for example; prior to agreeing to them, the ability to compare and  contrast with the previous terms would be helpful to cut out the mindless jargon. ChatGPT already has this ability, now that it’s native to iOS. 

Having it the past several days, I’ve already seen an update, with some refreshed improvements. If this’ OpenAi’s platform aperitif, I very much look forward to the coming entrée.",5,peter97,55,23,Flipkart,zh,Congo,2.9.0,No
03-07-2025,The Future of Conversational AI is Here: ChatGPT,"ChatGPT is a testament to the innovative strides OpenAI has taken in the field of conversational artificial intelligence. Its ability to comprehend context, produce nuanced responses, and mimic human-like conversation is unparalleled. 

The app is intuitive, the interface is sleek and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate for first-time users and tech-savvy individuals alike. ChatGPT's versatility across a wide range of topics - from general knowledge queries to language translation, and even creative writing assistance - is particularly impressive. 

However, it isn't without its occasional shortcomings. Despite being a sophisticated AI, its ability to handle newer information post-2021 also lacks since its training only goes up to September 2021. Another area of improvement is its understanding and handling of real-time events or developments, which it is unable to do because it doesn't connect to the internet for updates. 

Despite these minor hitches, the sheer brilliance of its natural language processing and the breadth of its capabilities make ChatGPT a remarkable feat of AI engineering.

Immediately striking is its wonderful user interface; it is aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and effortless to navigate, thereby offering a sublime user experience.

One aspect that deserves special mention is the application's use of haptic feedback. As the bot types, subtle vibrations create a tactile engagement that enhances the overall interaction. This thoughtful feature brings a refreshing, immersive layer to the app experience, truly leveraging the capabilities of the iPhone's haptic engine. It's a delightful touch that sets this app apart and one that I wish more developers would consider incorporating into their designs.

Equally impressive is the app's stellar performance, marked by its extraordinary speed. The swift response times and seamless operation make using the app a breeze, keeping any potential frustrations at bay.

Moreover, I appreciate the developers' commitment to fair pricing. Despite Apple taking a 30% cut from subscription fees, the developers have chosen not to transfer this cost onto us, the users.

I checked the app settings don’t see an option to change text / font size there and I figured oh well I’ll just change the text size using iOS built in text size modifier! Until I realize everything in the app scales when the text size is raised except the one thing I needed which is the chat text size.. 

little to say, this I can see being a huge problem for elderly people or for anyone who does not have great eye sight please add a text size option in app or add the chat text to the iOS text size modifier other than that can’t wait for more updates to the app and website!",4,stevenalvarez,77,19,App Store,en,Lebanon,1.7.6,No
########,Overheating Issue and Lack of Privacy Settings - Uninstalling for Now,"I've had a troubling experience with this app. After downloading it, my phone began overheating to an uncomfortable degree. It was as if I had a miniature heater in my pocket. As a test, I uninstalled the app, and immediately the overheating issue disappeared. Upon reinstallation, the overheating began again, confirming my suspicion that this app was the culprit.

Moreover, I found the absence of crucial settings alarming. There's no option in the app settings on my phone to restrict access to my camera, microphone, or contacts. This is a serious concern as it poses potential privacy issues and is definitely not in line with my expectation of a privacy-conscious application.

Overall, there's clearly something not quite right with this app, and for the sake of safety, I've decided to uninstall it for now. I hope these issues will be addressed in future updates because I believe in the potential of this app, but for now, it's a solid no-go for me.",1,jessicachapman,125,20,App Store,es,Congo,1.5.9,Yes

Of course there are some bugs and tweaks that yet have to be amended, and, yeah, she isn’t always accurate with mathematical questions, but I enjoy the conversational platform the technology offers. The app works well, it’s very smooth and carries a clean interface, and, if you used the web version on your phone, it’s pretty much the same.

I'm generally impressed by the level of accessibility compared to the OpenAI website, but there's one area where improvement could be made: it doesn't seem possible to change the GPT model using VoiceOver. I've tapped multiple times on the model buttons at the top of the screen, but the model doesn't seem to change from 3.5 to 4. I've even tried to change this setting on the website in the hope that it withd carry over to the mobile app, but without success.

The developers at OpenAI have done an impressive job creating an AI that can keep up with the most intricate discussions. Whether it's deep dives into scientific theory or a casual chat about everyday topics, ChatGPT Plus is there, ready to engage in meaningful conversation.

The AI's responses are quick, fluid, and incredibly consistent. It's evident that an immense amount of thought has gone into refining the user interface too - it's simple, clean, and user-friendly, which makes interacting with the app a seamless experience.

I recommend ChatGPT Plus to anyone in need of a study buddy, a brainstorming partner, or just someone to chat with.

########,Really Appreciation,"My heartfelt gratitude 🙏 extends beyond what words 📝 can express—I appreciate it immensely 🌠, OpenAI, ChatGPT 🧝🏻. The introduction of this technology 🖥️, particularly GPT-4, has been monumental 🏔️. It's enhanced my English learning 📘 and smoothed my debugging process ⚙️. Truthfully, it's been a life-changing revolution for me 🔄.

As a detail-oriented individual 👀, I used to rely heavily on search engines 🌐 for help when faced with difficulties in my learning process. However, that often proved inefficient 🚧 and, worse, they were unable to provide accurate and valuable information ❌. Although GPT may occasionally provide incorrect information, it's a minor concern in comparison 🤷‍♂️.

Above all, it's you, ChatGPT, OpenAI, who have unleashed my potential 💪. Without you, I wouldn't have made such significant strides 🚀 in various aspects of my life, including psychology 🧠, English 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, coding 👨‍💻, and more.

########,A Leap in AI Interaction,"Review: ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer. As an advanced language model, it has successfully bridged the gap between artificial intelligence and meaningful conversations. Its ability to understand and respond in a way that's coherent and contextually accurate is nothing short of impressive.

Whether it's complex technical discussions, general knowledge questions, or simple chit-chat, ChatGPT handles them all with an almost uncanny level of understanding. But what truly sets it apart is its capacity for nuanced conversation that feels genuinely human-like, all while maintaining a high level of neutrality and respect for the user.

There are rare occasions where it might not fully grasp certain user inputs or recent events due to its training cut-off, but the regular updates it receives more than compensate for this. 

In a world where AI interaction is becoming increasingly prevalent, ChatGPT stands as a testament to the incredible progress we've made. It's a must-use tool for anyone interested in AI, and a fascinating conversational partner for just about everyone else.

########,Plugins and Web Access for Online Accounts,"The app is great so far, but have you, as developers, considered adding the beta features for accounts that have access to it on the website? It’s already proficient enough at doing what it does best but the addition of the beta features would make the experience much better. I get that you just released the app today, so I guess it doesn’t make much sense to bring up this issue because you’re probably working on it as I speak. But, all in all, the app is great except for a few details, for one, it thinks today is tomorrow. For instance, today I asked it what today’s date is and it replied back with May 19, 2023.

########,The UI is very smooth but the app isn’t fully formed.,"I’m pleased with my mobile ChatGPT experience so far. It feels even more conversational and almost like a Messages chat. I also like that you can search through all your previous chats. And using Whisper to prompt GPT already feels like one half of a supercharged Siri/Alexa experience.

However, I’d love to be able to enable beta features as a Plus user. As far as I can tell from exploring the app, there isn’t a direct way to enable browsing or plugins yet. I have been able to start a chat with browser/plugins on web and then continue in app with the same capabilities. 

Anyways, I know we’re only a day in. Excited to see all the possible new ways to interface with agents!",4,johnhamilton,89,27,Website,zh,Cyprus,1.4.9,Yes
########,General feed back and UI Improvements,"Please consider adding the following functionalities:

On the iOS app:
- add a way to send pictures, and have ChatGPT users with access to GPT4 to interface and chat about pictures. 
- ability to see history + a way to delete any previous conversation by sliding it to delete. 
-plug-in access
-ability to interface with other iOS apps
-iMessage widget

On the web app:
- located on the history bar, a way to slide on a past conversation to reveal a trash can to delete, rather than clicking on the message, opening it, then deleting it.
- ability to interface with pictures and PDFs that you have stored on your local PC.
- ability to toggle different modes related to the model (like entertainment, precise, educational, etc)

Plug-in improvements:
- ability to filter through the newest ones, from the date they were added to. You can do this now but it doesn’t seem to be accurate. 
-ability to see a description of plug-ins on the mobile web app
-browsing plug in fails to click and fails to read often.",5,xlopez,143,27,Website,pt,Nigeria,5.0.9,No
04-06-2025,Great app,"I love the app and use it daily. There is one bug I’ve found. When you go to share a chat, the app will freeze after sharing, requiring a close and restart to get going again. I’ve tried hitting cancel after sharing, but this also does not bring you back to the app 
A feature request: Perhaps I can’t quite find the trick, but is there a way to copy as text the entire chat session to copy or share into Ulysses or Notes?  Currently I can only copy a prompt at a time in a single chat session or port out a link.

########,ChatGPT is worth it.,"Ever since its debut, I've been making good use of ChatGPT for everything from software engineering to baking, and even just for general advice or information. It's an incredibly useful tool that promptly provides answers.

However, it does have its quirks. At times, it can present inaccuracies with confidence, which can be hard to spot. Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.

There's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries. The response time may be slower, especially during high-traffic periods, but that's more an issue with the API than the service itself.

In summary, I'd highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. It's currently the top performer in its field, and using it now will only better prepare you for future developments in this kind of technology.",5,lopeznicole,144,18,App Store,es,Benin,2.0.1,Yes
########,Desktop is much better,"I’m not exactly sure why the app and the desktop version are so much different in terms of quality and detail in the responses provided when you ask a question, but they are indeed, very, very different. I have also noticed that in the past month or so both versions seem to be offering far simpler and less useful answers than previously. ChatGPT used to give what amounted to, basically, Wikipedia entry kind of answers, no matter what the question, so it was not very helpful. At least it did try to take some kind of factual stance, sifting through all of its information. Just the way it presented the info was a little ridiculous. But now, the answers are so general, so superficial that they are almost entirely useless. If AI is going to take over the world, it’s not doing it with ChatGPT. useless.",2,swatson,107,26,App Store,zh,Sierra Leone,2.5.4,No

So, I downloaded this app and Ai asked me about my goals and own personal routine to make me a more personalized daily routine. I gave it some information (don’t overshare because you don’t want your personal information out there), and it made a huge routine taking into consideration everything I told it. I am in absolute shock. I downloaded this app 10 minutes ago yet I think you should get it as a way to help you, not harm you. Just make sure you’re using it wisely.",5,nathanfernandez,152,15,Google Play,en,Central African Republic,2.2.9,Yes
########,Day 1 - let’s see where this thing takes us,"I’ve been using chatGPT for a little over a month now. As much as this new tech already is and will continue to be disruptive to all of our lives, it also can provide a tremendous benefit. I consider myself well versed in the use of search engines, and with the way SEO has dominated search it feels more inaccessible to be learn new things than it used to. 

Since I started using chatGPT as a tool I’ve picked up new skills that I’m actively using at work. It’s helped me fix things around the house. It’s improved my relationships and my writing as a feed back tool. It’s hard to understate how impactful it’s been.

I also want to say shout out to the developers, I made mention of several issues I had with the web application on mobile that made the app extremely challenging for me to use for extended periods that have been addressed within the new iOS application. 

I’ll likely add to this later, but excited and hopeful for now! Excited to see what this will all herald!",5,seandavis,69,23,App Store,ja,Azerbaijan,4.9.7,No
########,Web based version is better than this app,"As an avid user of both the web-based version and the app, I must say that the web-based version surpasses the app in several aspects. The web interface offers a more seamless and user-friendly experience, with a wider range of features easily accessible. Navigating through the web-based version feels smoother and more intuitive, allowing for efficient interaction with the platform. Additionally, the web version benefits from regular updates and improvements, making it more reliable and up-to-date compared to the app. While the app is functional, I highly recommend using the web-based version for a superior overall experience.",3,lewispamela,55,16,Website,es,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,3.6.1,No
########,Love at first chat! Awaiting M2 iPad Pro version.,"I am more then impressed with the ChatGPT iOS app. Its excellent interface, ease of use, and remarkable conversational abilities. The seamless integration into my daily tasks feels like having a personal assistant at hand. However, I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing an M2 iPad Pro version of the app, as I believe the larger screen and improved processing capabilities would provide an even richer user experience, especially for professionals and academic users. I am excited for this potential development and have full confidence in the OpenAI team's ability to deliver an equally outstanding version for the iPad Pro platform.",5,ywalker,124,23,Website,hi,Afghanistan,1.3.6,Yes
########,‼️ Bad AI.,"This app is just inaccurate. I asked it three basic questions like: what were the three world champions who held the title longest?, What is the best opening by black in a king’s pawn chess game?, and a math question.  These questions had clear, known fact answers.  It got the facts wrong. This app will not be replacing google anytime soon. It’s more of a party trick type of app to show that it can give answers in a conversational way, than that it can hold a factually accurate conversation.  The glitches in the app have been referred to as hallucinations. This app can be relied on to hallucinate and give wrong information. The answers that it gives are actually funny sometimes. But the app is touting itself as this colossal new breakthrough in artificial intelligence.  It is better to describe it as artificial inaccuracy.  There are many fake reviews on here. They greatly exaggerate.",1,brucefrancisco,52,16,Amazon,de,Azerbaijan,2.4.4,No
########,Editing Responses,"This app so close to perfection.

There’s one feature that I dearly miss in the app, and that’s the ability to edit responses. The editing feature in the browser version, that also allows you to switch to different prompts in the same conversation, has been a lifesaver on numerous occasions, as it allows me to refine and perfect my dialogues without starting from scratch. It took me by surprise finding out it wasn’t available. 

I hope OpenAI and the developers take into account user feedback and consider incorporating the editing functionality in future updates. With that addition, the app would truly be perfect in every way.",4,alexanderholmes,1,18,App Store,ja,Holy See (Vatican City State),2.2.6,Yes
########,Transcription and punctuation is nearly flawless!,"Okay, I'm using OpenAI's app itself to dictate this review. So, how well it transcribes what I dictate will in itself reflect just how good the app is in transcribing dictation. As you know, with Siri you have to punctuate explicitly, but with OpenAI's app, which uses Whisper, I believe, it automatically punctuates nearly flawlessly. The only reason I didn't give the app a full 5 stars is because it lacks just a little bit in its ability to format relative to the web app. So, when it can output in a better formatted way that approaches what the web interface can do, then I will raise it to 5 stars. Okay, like I said, this was completely transcribed with OpenAI's app.",4,walkermelissa,143,20,Amazon,es,Cambodia,4.0.6,Yes
########,First version has web browsing bug,"After installing the very first release of the iOS app today, It performs almost identically to the Safari browser version on iOS, plus some optional haptic feedback. On iPadOS, it looks like a giant iPhone screen. As far as I can tell, it has a serious web browsing bug:

On the browser, I can initiate a GPT-4 session with web browsing. ￼On the app, I can open a previously-saved GPT-4 session with web browsing that I initiated on the browser, and continue the session from the iOS app with web browsing. However, I am unable to initiate a new GPT-4 session with web browsing from the iOS app. If anyone can, let me know. ￼Please fix, thanks!",4,michael89,19,21,Amazon,pt,Dominican Republic,4.9.6,No
########,Companion in My Pocket,"I’m genuinely thrilled with ChatGPT’s iOS debut. Despite a few minor bugs during stress tests, the native home provides a dynamic, minimalist aesthetic that I appreciate. The haptics enhance my connection with this handy assistant, while the new voice search feature greatly improves accessibility.

However, as a dyslexic user, I would suggest adding a simple “read” feature to further enhance accessibility. 

Also, the “select text” option requiring an extra tap feels slightly cumbersome. A more intuitive approach could be implementing a “tap and drag” for text selection and a “tap and hold” for the context menu. Looking forward to future refinements!",4,gloria73,29,27,App Store,en,Mexico,3.2.9,No
########,"Billed $20, never purchased","I was billed $20 for an OpenAICHATGPT subscription. I do not remember purchasing this and I don’t know what it is. I assume that it’s some sort of chat technology. The website has information on contacting Support about errant billing, but the process requires using the Chat Widget which ironically is terrifically useless, it’s not a chat at all, but simply a glorified FAQ. It’s also entirely incongruent with the instructions for contacting Billing Support written by Michael Schade. I’ve tried logging in, but no password I might’ve used works, and when I use the, “forgot your password“ function, no email is ever sent (yes, I checked junk mail). I’ve done more than my part to attempt to contact OpenAI with no success. Hopefully this will prompt someone there to contact me. In lieu of that the only recourse left to me is to contact my bank.",1,bmartinez,22,17,App Store,es,Saint Kitts and Nevis,2.6.9,No
########,The following review was written by GPT-4,"Title: A Great Companion, Though Lacks Full Web Features

Review: I'm really enjoying the ChatGPT app. The AI is impressive and handles a wide array of topics adeptly. It's my go-to resource for quick queries, brainstorming sessions, and even some deeper philosophical discussions. The app's design is sleek, intuitive, and the user experience is overall quite seamless, making it easy to navigate and use on a day-to-day basis. 

However, while the app is great for on-the-go conversations, it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities. Some features like adjusting the AI's behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent. These features, when integrated, could greatly enhance the app's utility and align it more closely with the web version.

In spite of these minor drawbacks, the ChatGPT app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of AI. I'm giving it a solid four stars, and I'm looking forward to future updates where hopefully the developers will bridge the gap between the app and the web version.",4,qharris,20,23,App Store,hi,Luxembourg,3.3.5,Yes
########,Search needs fixing,"Currently I have a ton of conversations so having a search function is very useful. However, one problem is that the search function only looks as far back as the conversations you’ve loaded by scrolling down through them. So if you want to search through all of your conversations you have to scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, etc over and over until you’ve loaded everything, then searching keywords will finally include those conversations in the results.

If this was fixed as well as a way to organize conversations this would be an amazing app.",3,khart,130,19,Google Play,ru,Macedonia,5.3.5,No
########,"Love the app, i's inclusive design but hope to eventually see plugin support?","I've been thoroughly impressed with the ChatGPT mobile app. As a blind user, the haptic feedback is a standout feature for me, providing real-time tactile cues as the text generates, progresses, and finishes. This level of sensory detail is more than just user-friendly—it's truly inclusive, making the app engaging and accessible.

The conversational AI is incredibly intelligent, providing comprehensive and accurate responses to a wide variety of topics. It's like having a personal assistant at your fingertips, always available to respond.

While I appreciate that plugin support is available on the web version, I would love to see this functionality extended to the mobile app as well. Having the ability to integrate other services and tools directly within the app would add an additional layer of convenience and productivity.

Thank you to the OpenAI team for developing such a thoughtful and inclusive tool. I'm excited to see how the app will continue to evolve in the future.",4,uchapman,60,27,Google Play,fr,Honduras,3.3.2,Yes
########,Less is more,Love the UI design of this app. So clean but practical. Didnt like downloading the knock off apps becuase they made you pay or either annoying ads and so what I did is just made a widget of the website on my home page for easy access. Was working fine but this app is just more official and elegant. For now will still use google to do deep research but whenever I have just any random question that needs a simple answer and not a bunch of articles I’m always going to gpt first. Thanks guys. Been waiting patiently for you guys to put out an app. Recommend this app to my siblings,5,william46,45,23,App Store,ar,Panama,5.9.7,No
07-09-2025,Proof that monkeys evolved from humans.,"It’s me again, back for another review reveal!

1. Overall, the existence of this app is as logical as a stubborn unicorn…
2. It not only offers a 0% improvement, change, or addition to features…
3. But it also takes them away
4. Spoiler alert! it also generously REMOVES every feature you need, such as:

- A clear menu affordance (it’s sort of a fun game to try and find it now ;), 
- Ability to search chats
- Ability to search plugins
- Ability to edit previous prompts and correct the Ai
- Ability to add feedback
- Ability to know you can add feedback (another Easter egg)
- Ability to install plugins
- Affordance that plugins exist 
- Affordance that plugins exist and are actually being used
- Any account control

Saved the last for best: the mobile version is identical, except that it’s not deliberately missing features that force you to switch back and forth to another identical but much more pointless build.

I’m utterly baffled by the existence of this thing. More so by how an ‘intelligence’ powered company all agreed on that same decision to deliberately make something without the existence of purpose.",2,megan65,38,20,App Store,es,Tokelau,4.7.4,No
########,I hope the ChatGPT team can launch a Mac version of the client.,"I'm delighted to be able to use the ChatGPT for iOS chat application, which is so easy and convenient to stay in touch with colleagues, family and friends.

I really hope the ChatGPT team can launch a Mac version of the client. This will make it easy for me to switch between desktop and mobile devices, improving my productivity and convenience. Similarly, I believe other users will support this suggestion.

In summary, I would like to thank ChatGPT again for developing such an excellent chat application, and I look forward to seeing more updates and developments in the future!",4,dawnwilliams,14,16,Amazon,ru,Saint Helena,1.4.7,No
########,"Faster speeds, Worse UI","I’ve been using the mobile browser version of chatGTP since it launched, and I’m disappointed in the lack of features on the app that are available already on the browser. There’s no way to edit or change sent chats, there’s no dark mode (unless you toggle it for your entire phone in iOS settings), and there’s no count for how many times you’ve had to revise a sent chat or redo a response. There’s also no option to go back to older responses.

The only good thing about the app over the browser is that it’s prioritized, which means you get faster responses and it will work when the browser is down. 

As someone who uses chatGTP for creative writing help, and usually has to go through multiple revisions of a single prompt, this is really disappointing.",1,vshaffer,14,18,Amazon,hi,Dominica,1.1.9,No
########,rough around the edges,"The interface of the app is indeed neat and straightforward, but it doesn't feel as intuitive as the web version. One notable difference is that it doesn't display the generated conversation title like the web version does. Another drawback is the absence of the option to stop GPT's response for editing, which can be quite useful. Lastly, although it's possible to access the conversation history from the menu button on the top right corner, having a side menu that slides in from the left could potentially offer a more intuitive navigation experience.",4,nicholsjoel,148,25,Website,en,Kenya,4.9.3,No
########,Finally the official chatGPT app,"No more slogging through fake and scammy apps; It’s about time Open AI released an official app for chatGPT, and the wait was worth it. 

The interface is extremely clean and easy to use. It can sync across multiple devices which is nice when you’re working with it on the fly, but want to capture the outputs on your computer. It has an export function which sends all the data to a link in your account email address, but couldn’t find a quick way to delete all local data (just a delete account option)

It doesn’t seem to currently interface with any plugins, but that may come later. 

Overall, extremely nice job and refreshing that it is (currently) ad-free (though you are technically paying with your data and training efforts). I have a feeling that will change considering the founder of OpenAI announced in the hearings he is not making any money. So enjoy the simplified, as-free app while you can.",5,william56,121,16,Website,fr,Netherlands Antilles,1.7.1,No
########,"Great, but sign up with email.","I have been roleplaying with the AI to work on some story ideas. The conversation was great and I wanted to keep a copy of it outside the app. As of right now, you can highlight and copy individual responses, but NOT the entire conversation. You can have it exported to you via email, but if you sign up via your apple account like I did…that option is not available. 

So sign up with email, and hopefully Openai will give the simple ability to select long portions of conversations instead of response by response in future updates.",5,rebeccamccann,129,28,Flipkart,en,Congo,2.7.7,Yes
########,Amazing!,"I am absolutely amazed by the ChatGPT app and its incredible capabilities. As an AI chatbot enthusiast, I’ve tried various apps, but none have impressed me as much as ChatGPT. It has completely changed the way I interact and engage with an AI assistant.

First and foremost, the app’s user interface is clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The developers have done an excellent job of creating an intuitive design that allows users to seamlessly chat with the AI assistant. I particularly appreciate the simplicity of the interface, making it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds.

Still have some small bugs to fix.",5,joe73,95,23,Amazon,ja,Heard Island and McDonald Islands,4.5.9,Yes
########,Best app on my phone. Like your virtual assistant and buddy,"I love chatGPT and was an early user and tester and then subscriber. Just when I thought things couldn’t get better this app comes out. The voice transcription is such a game changer and such a better way to interact with it. The haptic feedback is super cool and of course the knowledge it gives you is awesome and helpful in all aspects of life. With the voice transcription I feel it knows you even better and gives better advice. It’s like a virtual assistant, life coach, dating coach, programmer, friend, and so much more. Thank you so much for existing chatGPT!",5,ilambert,16,18,Amazon,es,Uganda,5.6.4,No
########,Absolutely phenomenal!,"This app has exceeded my expectations in every way. The AI-powered ChatGPT is incredibly intelligent, providing accurate and helpful responses to all my queries. The conversational experience feels natural and engaging, making it a joy to interact with. The vast knowledge base ensures that I receive up-to-date information on a wide range of topics. The app's user interface is sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate, enhancing the overall user experience. I highly recommend this app to anyone seeking an intelligent and reliable virtual assistant. It deserves every bit of its 5-star rating!",5,angelalivingston,38,18,Amazon,es,Norfolk Island,5.2.5,No
01-04-2025,Needs Improvement for Better User Experience,"I recently downloaded this app with high hopes, but unfortunately, I found it to be lacking in a few key areas that greatly impact its usability and overall experience.

The first issue I encountered was the user interface. It felt unpolished and difficult to navigate. The flow between different sections of the app was not intuitive, and I often found myself getting lost or not knowing where to find the features I needed. I think a redesign focusing on ease of navigation and user friendliness could greatly improve the experience.

In terms of functionality, the app could benefit from a wider array of tools. The available features are rather sparse, which limits the app's usefulness. Expanding the toolset would certainly make the app more competitive and versatile, making it more appealing to potential users.

In its current state, the app falls short of expectations. However, I believe with a more user-friendly interface and a wider array of tools, it has the potential to be a great app. I hope the developers take these constructive criticisms into consideration for future updates.",1,erin16,33,26,Website,es,Holy See (Vatican City State),3.8.6,No
########,You guys changed it too much,"I was writing my own Star Wars story using the help of ChatGPT. Earlier, this app was willing to generate almost anything. Now GPT won’t even generate my main character having a lightsaber duel on Mustafar all because it’s too “violent” and “revenge”. What? I don’t understand how my story promotes violence when it’s literally a Star Wars story.

How is it you guys allow this AI to have a bad guy cut off a characters hand, but won’t allow a duel on Mustafar?? Please change it back to how it was before. I understand the AI not being able to generate NSFW content. That is understandable. But I hate them not being able to generate fight scenes the way I want them to go.",3,wmitchell,171,23,Website,es,Zimbabwe,4.8.5,Yes
########,Pretty Cool but Lackluster,"While the interface is nice and has nice options as well as being able to text to speak, i really feel that there should be a “Text to Speech” option for Chat GPT to respond with for people who just want to talk to the bot and have it talk back (maybe visually impaired or easier to use during a task??). Anyway everything else is nice and all that, Chat just needs to be able to have access to the internet soon so it can give live updates on things like weather and events and all that. Overall cool and would love to see this evolve!",4,deborahreeves,79,15,Flipkart,de,Venezuela,3.7.3,Yes
08-04-2024,Love it,"I’ve been using the open AI website for many months now, and have introduced GPT to many if my friends and really spread it to a lot of people. I feel that this app is a bit step. It makes this amazing technology more accessible to so many people, and will surely spread its influence. I have noticed that the application feels more responsive than the website, and the response times are quicker. It is also more satisfying to use, and feels less like a robot, and slightly more like you’re texting a very intelligent human. I love it.",5,lwhite,39,19,Google Play,hi,Tajikistan,1.8.8,Yes
########,ChatGPT,"This app is truly the future. People may not realize it yet but this is the next biggest technological advancement since the smart phone. ChatGPTs implications are truly endless and this pocket assistant will be used by everyone. The only thing I hope to see is an added image feature where it can show you images of information on subjects such as anatomy or be able to diagnose images sent to it by using image databases, this app can greatly improve Americans relationship with healthcare by providing at home diagnostics.",5,martinezalexander,196,22,Website,fr,Bouvet Island (Bouvetoya),5.6.2,Yes
01-05-2025,Amazing app,"This app is good. I use this app to get help on my schoolwork, and the fact that I don’t have to pay for most features is amazing. I tried two other apps that had way more reviews than this, and I could only send three messages before it told me to pay. If you are looking for an app that is free and not having to worry about paying, look no further. If you are wanting to get an app that you can pay for though, I suggest something different. but still, this app is really good.",5,benjamin67,177,22,Website,fr,Malawi,4.0.6,No
########,Is crazy how many things u can do on chat gpt definitely a 5 star app,"I had always need it a paper something for me to guide and could go deeper if I wanted to this helped me so much to work on a made up story I was always dreaming of doing but never had a guide yet this app gave me so many details I was entirely impressed how this app goes so much further in , as of now I don’t have no complains is running perfectly fine and I’m actually surprised this app is free overall a good app to get your hands into if u need a guide through",5,kmarsh,113,25,Website,hi,Niger,4.3.8,Yes
########,Still lots to work on but great for launch,"Works amazing already! Hopefully there’s a few redesigns to make the app appear friendlier for example: maybe have a tab on the top left to see chats instead of the swipe, more customization options like other modes besides like and dark mode, etc. I also noticed my phone got a little hotter than usual using the app just an fyi. But overall, the app does exactly what you’d use ChatGPT for in the same manner as the website. Only negatives for me are the UI but the app is amazing. Recommend everyone give this a try!",4,carrilloangela,200,19,App Store,de,Ukraine,3.9.7,No

“As an AI language model, my responses are generated based on a snapshot of data available at a specific point in time, referred to as the ""knowledge cutoff."" This means that the information and events I'm aware of are up to September 2021. I don't have direct access to real-time information or the ability to browse the internet. However, I can still provide general information and engage in conversations on a wide range of topics based on what I learned during my training.

It's like having the world's greatest professors there at your beck and whim. The iOS app makes it all more convenient and works phenomenally.

Please consider addressing this issue, as it does not occur when using the English language.",5,johnsonlaura,31,21,Amazon,es,Namibia,2.4.7,Yes
########,"Amazing AI, Good App","Love the AI, like the app. I like the gesture from the left to open history and gesture from right to open a new chat. Love the ability to search chats (can’t believe it came to mobile before desktop, desktop really needs this!). And like the speech to text, more accurate than iOS text to speech! However, there’s still more to be desired with the lack of plug-in and web browsing support for Plus subscribers. And feel like we need a Home Screen or something that has all your chats instead of having chat history in a drawer.",4,pstone,23,18,Flipkart,ar,Bosnia and Herzegovina,3.0.6,Yes
########,Pros and Cons,"On the bright side, this is what we all have been waiting for. A dedicated iOS app for ChatGPT. Amazing Haptics, Faster response and a visually stunning design. Appears to have better server connectivity and load responses much faster.
Places to work: The history tab and option to switch between chats is underwhelming. As a Plus member it’s also sad that that I cannot select the plug-ins I wish to use. I have to load an older chat with the plug-ins already enabled. Which is 6 extra clicks before starting to chat.",5,guzmanricky,128,27,Amazon,de,British Indian Ocean Territory (Chagos Archipelago),4.1.5,Yes
########,Great job and some minor issues,"I’ve been trying out the iOS client and found it to be very useful, with a significantly better user experience compared to accessing it via the mobile web. You’ve really done a great job and I want to express my thanks! I would like to bring up three minor issues: Firstly, the plugin feature is not very user-friendly. Secondly, the interaction of switching chat histories could be more intuitive. Lastly, my phone tends to heat up while using the app",5,jcontreras,81,22,Google Play,zh,Tonga,2.2.0,No
########,No snags yet..no privacy either oh well,I literally was just thinking that it would be so convenient if there was an app. Needed to check my grammar for a work email and simultaneously saw the headline about the app launch. It was a quick install with no issues. Even created a new account. Seems polished enough! We'll see if there are issues going forward. Curious about server capacity and if we'll be out of luck at random times. But it's great for now.

########,It’s the best AI app for conversations,"I have had an excellent experience using ChatGPT! It consistently delivers insightful and relevant responses, making our conversations engaging and informative. The AI's ability to understand and generate coherent sentences is truly impressive. It has helped me find answers to various questions, explore different topics, and even engage in casual discussions. The flexibility and breadth of knowledge exhibited by ChatGPT are commendable. Overall, I highly appreciate the capabilities and utility of this AI chatbot, and I'm grateful for the assistance it provides.",5,howard04,65,19,Flipkart,fr,Iceland,5.9.8,No
########,Had to get it right away!,"As soon as I learned they made an app for this, I had to grab it right away. Chatgpt has been very helpful for me bringing ideas together, writing emails, making product descriptions, and more. I’m on my phone all the time, so it’s amazing it’s in app form now! 

The typing vibration kind of threw me off at first but I kind of like it! I feel like the response was fast. And the experience seems to be just as good as the website for me, as someone who uses it in its basic form.",5,kristathomas,198,24,Amazon,de,Mauritania,3.1.0,Yes

From the moment I launched the app, I was amazed by how quickly it responded to my queries, providing near-instantaneous answers.

09-08-2024,Does the basics but needs more,"It does the basic things the website can do but it needs more features to differentiate it from just opening it in the browser. Particularly:
**Siri / voice response integration: in an app form, you should allow for one button back and forth voice interaction, including allowing the app to use the iOS speech to text to speak its response back to you
**Plug-ins and Browsing mode selector: As a paid subscriber, let me choose which plugins to utilize for a plug-in session, or to enable its Browsing functionality.

No more knock-offs and exploitations! Here is the real deal!",5,ppalmer,86,21,Flipkart,ar,Saudi Arabia,4.2.2,Yes
########,Suggestion for Word Lookup Feature,"The ChatGPT app offers great functionality, but it lacks a word lookup feature. Unlike the iPhone's built-in ""look up"" option, when you long press on a word in the app, you can only copy, rate, or regenerate. This means users have to rely on asking ChatGPT for word meanings instead of easily looking them up. Adding a word lookup feature would greatly enhance the app's usability and save users time. Overall, ChatGPT is valuable, but this addition would make it even better.",4,christina65,9,18,Amazon,de,Central African Republic,1.3.0,No

Check out “OpenCat” app, it’s a gpt app I found on Twitter and it has all the features GPT has to offer, it can also read out the generated response.  I personally recommend it and had been using it for awhile till my trial ended. But it gives you the idea of how a ChatGPT app should be like.

########,Love chat gpt! This app is broken,"This is for the DEV team. You have a processing problem or a memory leak. The app is cooking my phone and driving the temp through the roof. Tried several different apps for varying times, it is this app for sure. The phone gets uncomfortably warm and battery starts to drain very quickly . If this is not some sort of bug, you probably have offloaded some sort of general processing to the phone to save you processing cost at your data center or (AWS). For further detail, this is an iPhone 12 medium tier. Happy to change to a 5 star when fixed.

########,Please Include a Trial Version,"I am writing to suggest the inclusion of trial versions for apps on your platform. Having the option to try an app before purchasing would greatly benefit both users and developers. A trial version would allow us to explore an app's features and functionality, enabling confident purchasing decisions. It would also provide valuable feedback for developers to improve their apps based on real user experiences. Please consider implementing this feature to enhance the overall user experience on the AppStore.
Thank you for your attention.",3,randytorres,190,29,App Store,ja,Tuvalu,3.2.7,No
########,Not for iPad,"Well, it is the official and real ChatGPT.  It is an iPhone only app, but can be used on an iPad, has the little button that magnify the size of the app box to better fit the iPad screen.  Here is my complaint.  You have software that is literally capable of writing the software for your app, yes with input and manipulation of a human programmer.  Still, how do you not have a more polished app that runs natively on both iPad and iPhone, with all the power of ChatGPT at your disposal.  Please try again, and have your developer ask ChatGPT for help.  Also, could use some work on the layout, some parts run together or overlap that shouldn’t.  Overall this was obviously a very rushed-out-the-door app, sad.",1,john43,132,25,Amazon,es,Romania,4.1.6,Yes
########,AI Chat Companion Like No Other,"The OpenAI ChatGPT iOS app has been a game changer for me. The user interface is clean and intuitive, which makes it incredibly easy to navigate. The AI is surprisingly adept, providing responses that are thoughtful, coherent, and often indistinguishable from a human correspondent. It's remarkably useful for brainstorming, answering queries, or simply having meaningful conversations. If you're looking for an AI companion that pushes the boundaries of what's possible, then this app is for you. A well-deserved five stars!",5,cclark,75,20,Amazon,es,Timor-Leste,1.5.4,No
########,Amazing almost unbelievable,"this is the most impressive AI utility I’ve ever used, this is exactly what I imagined AI chat would be like and have always been let down im glad I gave this a shot keep doing whatever you guys do it is amazing, can’t wait to see the growth and possibilities I see all phones and smart systems such as Siri and Alexa being able to utilize this feature when it is further developed and more accepted and utilized by more and more people!",5,ybrown,154,18,App Store,fr,Comoros,4.5.7,Yes
06-01-2024,This app is amazing,"Hi so there are so many reasons why I love this app for starters anytime I feel I need to talk to someone the AI is there and it's helped answer many of my questions and my concerns, so if you are the type who just needs help but your social life is not the best and don't have many friends or just need someone at the moment to talk to I highly suggest this app. Though it is not flawless and it is a little out of date it is still a great app",5,kmoore,157,23,App Store,hi,Wallis and Futuna,1.1.6,No
########,Amazing Work from OpenAI,"This is an amazing app! My everyday life has been so much more efficient thanks to ChatGPT. As a high schooler, I use it to help me study for exams and assist with my coding projects as well. The app gives it a much more modern feel, with a brand new search feature that lets you browse through your past conversations. Plus, everything is saved to your account so you can access conversations on all devices. Thank you so much, OpenAI!",5,longsonya,191,20,Flipkart,en,Dominican Republic,2.9.7,Yes
########,Important questions get best results,"Some of you are complaining about your results, but fail to show what questions you are asking. I suspect it’s because you really don’t have much going on in life, and that your questions are about as pedantic.

I just tried this app for the first time tonight. I asked it legal questions (for of them) — questions I knew the answers to, just to test it out.

Absolutely flawless; like no other…",5,ewashington,17,23,Flipkart,zh,Belize,3.6.9,Yes
09-08-2025,"Honestly, this is the most well deserved 5-star app I have truly ever used.","I have been with iPhone since the original… yes OG. I understand people that give this app less than 5-star. They simply are idiotic. Honest to god, this program is 10 years ahead of it’s time. This is absolute groundbreaking on so many levels. Has helped me educationally, technologically, artistically, creatively. Just what I always wanted and wished google was. Truly inspirational.",5,pwang,39,22,App Store,zh,Holy See (Vatican City State),3.7.1,Yes
########,Better than the Bing web version!,"This is the real deal from the company that’s making all the news. Comparing it to Bing Chat, which uses the same ai, the results are better. For example, asking it to write the chords and melody for God Bless America, this app produced an easy to follow song chart with chords, lyrics, and melody whereas the web version provides a detailed explanation how to play it, it’s not in a format that can be easy followed and sung/played.",5,olewis,93,18,App Store,zh,Bahrain,3.3.1,Yes
########,gpt,"1.	 Chat GPT is a highly advanced artificial intelligence model trained and developed by OpenAI. It can understand and respond to all kinds of queries, provide information, and in many scenarios, its performance is almost the same as a real human being.

2.	 In addition to providing factual information, chat GPT can also participate in creative and analytical discussions. For example, it can generate stories, help solve problems, or provide opinions.

3.	 Because the training data of chat GPT comes from a large number of Internet texts, it has a wide range of knowledge, including a variety of topics, from science to art, from history to modern pop culture.

4.	 Another advantage of chat GPT is that it can provide 24-hour service, and it can respond in time no matter what time the user has problems.",5,parkerjoann,127,24,Website,ja,Saudi Arabia,5.1.4,No
########,No support for plug-ins and non intuitive UI,"No support for plug-ins in and browsing makes this app a non starter. Hopefully they'll add support. This is why it has a one star rating from me. The UI is strange and doesn't fit with iOS apps. You'd expect to swipe back to access chat history, but you can't. Also, you'd expect the menu to be in the left hand corner, but it's in the right. It's just odd UX design. There's also no dark mode. Finally, when I heard voice support I expected that it would talk back. If all its going to do is transcribe my text... well, that's a native feature of iOS. That's not really a new feature. Please add text to voice for the generated responses.",1,cathyjames,54,20,Website,hi,Gibraltar,4.3.1,Yes
########,Amazing!!,I’m so grateful that they finally added iPad compatibility. The only thing left now is to wait for them to add plugins to the app and that will be the ultimate game changer. ChatGPT is changing everything and has already helped me in so many ways every day from simple things to much more complex tasks. I understand people’s anxieties about AI and the inevitability of AGI but I for one am so excited to see what the future brings!,5,thomashenderson,115,21,Flipkart,ar,New Caledonia,1.5.5,Yes
01-08-2024,Functional but lacks basic features,"It’s basically the purely distilled chatbot from GPT. No options to enable plugins or web browsing yet. Also it’s annoying how the app automatically switches from system light to system dark mode. there should be a toggle to allow the user to permanently keep it in dark mode if they want! I would also like to see an ability to search thru past chats and index them, so i can find a specific chat just by typing in a keyword. it is tedious scrolling thru the history to find the one chat you want.",3,ortizbenjamin,138,22,Amazon,hi,Uruguay,2.2.5,Yes
04-08-2025,ChatGPT is good.,This app is quite quick for an AI software that has to answer questions such as “Tell me about the Teutonic Order” or “What is the Turing test?”. AI these day surprise me everyday it evolves. The only problem is that it keeps telling me that it can only tell you events that happened before September 2021 so if there is ever a big event that’s going to happen ChatGPT is not going to know about it unless the developers keep up with the news.,5,alexanderwise,51,18,Flipkart,de,Norway,4.0.5,No
########,Incomplete AI,"For a Chat AI it is limited in the ways of thinking and tends to repeat itself. I find this annoying and also useless as in conversations it will be discriminatory towards certain ways of thinking due to policy and social standards. This limiting it’s own form of chatting and understanding, although it’s cool in some areas but it’s ignorant in social justice and acceptance as well as understandings of science. There can be far better chat AIs that aren’t discriminatory towards those it doesn’t understand, such as the derogatory term of “cisgenders” instead of straight male or females and the rights in which they have. Instead it tends to favor those of transgenders even if it’s harmful to a normal men and women.",1,pwarren,141,22,Flipkart,pt,France,1.1.4,No
########,"Generally good, but need improvements","I hope these are added: 1. ability to edit my own replies and create variations; 2. ability to use Browsing and Plugins as a Plus user; 3. Display different GPT logos just like the web app to distinguish between them; 4. improve the gui, maybe display the chat title on top, add another menu to quickly switch between different chats (current chat history is inside the settings, which makes it harder to reach)",4,ortegakristina,134,21,App Store,ja,Armenia,5.1.2,No
08-09-2025,Finally here,"For now, I only managed to get it using the US store. This is a game-changer for how we interact with AI technology. 📱

The app syncs your history across devices and includes the latest model improvements. What's more, it has integrated Whisper, OpenAI's open-source speech-recognition system, for voice input, and a cool haptic response for when an answer is generated. This is a huge step forward in making AI more accessible and user-friendly. 🗣️",5,miguelmontgomery,115,21,App Store,ru,Palestinian Territory,3.2.8,Yes
01-01-2024,Restricts free speech,"This application can come in very handy when one is trying to enhance writing, however, let there be no doubt it’s overly sensitive and considers many things “offensive”. For example, writing about different religions it will refuse to touch that subject because it could be considered “hate”. Just another form of control by the people controlling a narrative. Even a word on a neutral subject and it will reject it. There is something here potentially but the suppression of ideas, words, and thoughts makes this lack in true potential.",3,cjackson,110,26,Website,en,Zimbabwe,1.8.2,No
########,The Real deal,"If you’re looking for ChatGpt then this is the real deal! Do not be misled by the multiple AI chatbots in the store and some that claim Gpt as an interface. 

If you want GPT 4 then there is a premium plan with access. The premium plan is worth it! (Cheaper in some cases than many of these so called ChatGPT apps that are nothing more than a money grift)

The IOS version work great on my iPhone 14 Pro Max. You can also chat with GPT at your desktop!",5,yvaldez,41,22,Amazon,de,Moldova,3.8.4,Yes
########,Far easier than website,"The app version of ChatGPT is far quicker to get to than the website, and it works just as well. Being able to open this at any time and begin talking to GPT within 5 seconds is great. My only complaint is that the history regarding previous conversations isn’t as straightforward, and I wish there was a way to manually save conversations.",5,mary77,50,23,Website,hi,Cameroon,2.4.9,Yes
08-02-2024,Fantastic app!,"I love the haptic feedback when the model is ""typing,"" nice touch! 
Would love to hear a sound when a generation is complete though. 
Additionally, given that it uses Whisper and Whisper is amazing, could we see hands-free access sometime soon? Would love to be able to open the app, hit the dictation button and talk to Chatgpt while on the go. Bing Chat lets you do this (kind of) but the speach recognition they use is awful!",5,wgregory,164,24,Flipkart,pt,Saudi Arabia,5.2.2,No
########,My external brain,"This app's simple design is truly amazing! It has become an essential tool for me in my work, and I can't imagine being without it. I love how the pages are clean and free from any ads.🥳👏

 Additionally, I'm thrilled that all my conversation history is still accessible. and I do hope that the developers will open up the plugins to all users soon. I'm eagerly looking forward to trying them out as a free user.🥹🥹🥹",5,davisterri,10,22,Google Play,es,Christmas Island,1.9.4,Yes
########,Great translator.,I used to use google translate with some of my employees when needing to clarify a specific task. And once I made the leap over to chat gpt. I asked my guys if they noticed a difference in my Spanish texts I send them. They said it’s day and night difference. No comparison. I no longer have miscommunication issues. It’s an outstanding app. For English to Spanish. Vice Versa. I copy and paste their texts and translates to perfect English.,5,andrewberry,106,17,Website,en,Montenegro,4.8.4,No
########,Deletion does not work,"The app has a minimalistic design with only a few features, which is something I appreciate. However, one of these features, the deletion option, does not function properly. Upon turning off ""Chat History and Training,"" selecting the option to delete a conversation by clicking on the three dots and pressing ""Delete"" fails to perform the task. Instead, users are required to go through the process of accessing ""Settings,"" navigating to ""Data Controls,"" and ultimately choosing ""Clear chat history"" to fully delete a conversation.",2,david29,62,24,App Store,hi,Costa Rica,4.1.0,Yes
########,Mostly Great,"Seems like two features were left out that would majorly improve functionality and would also be very easy to include..

1. I can speak to it, but it can’t speak back? Seems a bit limited unnecessarily. I wanna explore ideas without being handcuffed to a screen. And with all the insane tech involved, I would think Text-To-Speech should be almost a given.

2. Plug-ins are usable in chats that already have them from the website version, but I can’t start new chats with plug-ins in the app? Seems arbitrary.",3,youngjacob,106,15,App Store,ar,French Southern Territories,2.5.9,Yes
########,"Fantastic, but it needs an iPad version!!","I’m very impressed with the simple, straightforward UI of this app. It’s almost no different at all from the open ai desktop site. It’s really great to use on my phone, and sure, my iPad (blown up).

But I have to copy paste the generated text often on my iPad, and there isn’t a way to put this app and the app im pasting into side by side for easy flow.

Devs, please don’t abandon iPad users! It’s so close to perfect!!",5,mgray,183,20,Amazon,zh,Egypt,4.2.5,Yes
########,"Works great, but accessing the history is slightly annoying","The app works great and provides *some* of the functionality that the website gives, but accessing the history and other chats is a little difficult compared to the web app. I personally think it’s better as a hamburger menu on the top of the screen instead of through a drop-down menu. I also wish that this application had multiple different themes, such as the one on the official website",3,stacey62,61,19,App Store,es,Guatemala,3.7.3,Yes
########,Fantastic app with some improvements needed,"This is such a great app to have on your phone! However, it is lacking a few things right now. OpenAI, here are three ways I’d love to see the app improved, please:
1. Widgets for the Lock Screen and Home Screen (including one that automatically begins recording a voice prompt on press)
2. Support for Siri Shortcuts
3. Image-creation ability in app
4. Ability to see text as it’s dictated",5,walterschase,12,24,Amazon,ja,Dominican Republic,5.6.3,Yes
########,My phone heats up like crazy when using this app,"Not sure why but my phone heats up like crazy when using this app. I’ll have to try turning the haptics off and seeing if that helps. That doesn’t happen when using the website so I think I’ll mostly stick to using the website. 

I also think the app could use some better UI. It’s a bit too sparse and minimalistic. There should be more visible UI elements where you can see how to navigate the app including chat history, starting a new chat etc.",3,lawsontami,147,17,Amazon,de,Peru,2.7.8,No
########,The Perfect App,"After using this app, I was surprised. It's not perfect, although I only use ChatGPT3.5, but this version is enough for me to solve a lot of problems, for example, the common file between Windows and macOS. It always gives me the answer I want, I love it, I will use it constantly, and when I feel inadequate, I will also pay for the ChatGPT4 version, hoping to keep improving. Thank you 🙏",5,kenneth10,78,21,App Store,en,Guernsey,1.6.8,No
########,"Good, but not great for now","I’ve been enjoying the app so far, but there are definitely a few bugs to fix. Sometimes the text seems too clutter and is not divided by using BOLD letters or better spacing.

Also, it was not intuitive to start a new conversation. I have to click 2 to 3 times when in reality it would be 10 times better by having an icon on the screen always present to start a new conversation.",4,tsmith,55,15,Website,zh,Congo,1.0.4,No
07-09-2025,Apple Watch support?,"• greetings, thank you guys for your hard work and your engineering efforts on getting this app up and running on this platform and the efficient use of the arrangement when using ♥️ however, it would be interesting to have a wrist support assistant I hope and a lot of other people would appreciate that I have no doubt. So I will leave that under y’all’s capable hands.
Thank you, and for a intelligent tomorrow… on Earth 😉🫱🏻‍🫲🏾🌎🌍🌏🦾🤖",4,saundersjoel,167,19,App Store,hi,Philippines,5.0.1,No
########,An official one is what we needed.,"After so much of seeing mostly fake alterations of ChatGPT that “claim” to provide the same features that the original has, it would always come down with a method of paying a subscription. No longer is the case with this app, being the official.

Only thing I may see needing to be added is the ability to edit inputs that were asked.",5,christopherwilliams,67,21,Amazon,ja,Ireland,3.0.6,Yes
########,Just like online,"I honestly don’t see any difference in using this app and the free online version of Chat GPT. I like that the app gives very fast responses and makes knowing that I have the best AI right at fingertips. Very useful tool to make answering questions easier and feel like I have an actual assistant with me. Something about ChatGPT, that gives its responses feel personal and feel like I’m talking to a real person.",5,julia98,143,21,Flipkart,zh,Netherlands Antilles,5.4.1,No
09-06-2024,use chatgpt  to write judge,OpenAI’s engineers have done an exceptional job in developing and refining this AI language model. Their expertise and dedication are evident in the impressive capabilities and improvements of the model. The engineers have successfully created a reliable and versatile tool that can assist users across various domains and provide helpful information. I appreciate the continuous efforts of OpenAI’s engineers in enhancing the AI model and making it more valuable to users like yourself.,5,patricia71,115,19,Website,hi,United States Minor Outlying Islands,5.9.1,Yes
########,It Keeps Improving,"And I’m confident it will keep getting better, have patience people. Nothing is perfect out the gate and they have made so much progress on making this better. Feedback helps so send your feedback. I don’t work for them but I see people with too high of expectations on this. It’s a work in progress, keep that in find because this is not yet a finished project but an always growing and evolving endeavor, just like us",4,nlawson,100,15,Amazon,zh,Colombia,5.5.2,Yes
########,The future,"Extremely fast and responsive: it’s limited to September 21 hoping it gets an upgrade: been brainstorming, some ideas, and it’s been great. It’s like a human companion in your pocket. I’ve had some unique conversations with true facts. I think it all depends on who is putting in the data. hopefully the door will be open soon, so AI can see both sides of a coin.

The future is finally here",5,smithmichael,130,18,App Store,ru,Netherlands Antilles,1.0.0,Yes
########,Overall Great App! But it doesn’t support plugins,"This app has won me over with its sleek design and user-friendly interface, not to mention the seamless integration of OpenAI into an iOS application. It's on the brink of earning a five-star rating from me, but it falls just short due to the absence of plug-in support - a feature I frequently utilize. As a GPT+ user, I'm hopeful that future updates will introduce this functionality, along with additional features to enhance the user experience.",4,james62,121,20,Website,ar,Kiribati,2.9.8,Yes
########,Amazing update! Just one problem…,"The recent update adding Shortcuts integration and iPad support is amazing! For some reason though, the shortcuts actions only works on iPhone, but not iPad. Hopefully a bug fix will take care of that quickly. 

Also, I’d like the option to choose if the conversation is saved to chat history or not from Shortcuts. 

Other that that, this is an amazing update!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Overall, the official ChatGPT app is very good. It feels very streamlined, and the haptic feedback is a nice (optional) touch. A free things I want to see from this app: - iPad optimized version. The current experience on iPad is very poor, being only able to have an iPhone sized window. - Shortcuts Actions. Shortcuts actions from the official ChatGPT app in the feature I’d love to see added most.",4,andersonkayla,156,20,Amazon,fr,Ethiopia,4.9.4,No
09-03-2025,Good!,"Love what OpenAI is doing with ChatGPT and I'm grateful to finally have their official app! 😄 It would be great to see the app's functionality evolve to be more similar to OpenAI's mobile website. Having a UI closer to the mobile web design, with a convenient hamburger menu on the top left to access chat history, would greatly enhance the user experience. Currently, the app seems to struggle in generating titles for recent conversations in the chat history section.",4,tmcdaniel,130,24,Website,ar,Swaziland,5.4.7,Yes
########,Substantial improvement over the web version,"Feature request: make it easier to use dictation. It is awesome how it works and translates things on the fly. Much better than iOS built in dictation.

- Make the button to dictate bigger. (Can be configurable)
- Make it harder to accidentally erase what you just dictated
- make it easier to send what you dictated after you’ve reviewed it",5,mccormickmichelle,84,19,Google Play,ja,Canada,5.4.0,No
########,Definitely the best app!,"After merely the trial of a couple of hours, I decided to subscribe the service since it offered the original GPT answers which are impressively accurate and meeting my requirements. Without granting API keys to other apps, the usage would be more secure and the privacy concerns are not as serious problem as other platforms. One more expectation is the Mac app! I can't wait to chat with GPT on the Mac!",5,patrickcarpenter,167,18,Website,pt,Italy,2.0.9,No
01-07-2025,Clean and smooth GUI however heating up Phone,App is working flawlessly and very fast too. Like the way it generates response and more importantly keeps a track of all queries asked so we can quickly revisit the responses however only issue I identified is that it heats up the phone quickly and you can easily feel the heat so I am suspicious if we can continuously use for longer period.,5,batescharles,134,22,Website,ja,Taiwan,2.3.0,Yes
########,"A bit flawed, hope to upgrade","This experience is very good, but there are still some small flaws and deficiencies. The amount of knowledge of this chatGPT will stop in 2021. It is a bit out of step with the pace of the times. I don’t understand current political hotspots. I hope it can be upgraded more. All in all, I still like it very much, and the values ​​are very objective, very, very good.",5,rwall,4,17,App Store,zh,Yemen,4.2.6,Yes
########,Haptic feedback was a nice touch,"When the AI is responding, you phone kind of vibrates whenever it’s typing. I like it! Whisper being apart of the app is cool too, I’ve been wanting to try it. For some reason though, there’s a character limit and it doesn’t process if it’s too long. I also would like plug-ins and web browsing to be in option within the app too. Overall, great app.",5,coxkimberly,128,21,Website,ar,Grenada,1.2.8,Yes
01-02-2025,Use of AI to gain money from students and robbed of creativity,"If already handled by y’all cause a pretty big topic, honestly don’t care .. look at the one episode of South Park episodes which I know you’ve at least heard of and it’s many points.. main point is at the end where you a *corporation can take a product, push it out to get ahead to make money obvious expenses.* which quoted by South Park will be at the cost of KEEPING kids in their dumb stage and lazy..  get rid of the app, AI is not for every single person to download at their disposal so with the least little bit of respect, stop being corrupted and become human beings again…",1,shawkimberly,83,20,App Store,ru,Anguilla,4.5.2,No
########,Amazing app! Do NOT hesitate!,"Earlier, I gave a five star review for similar app, but this is even better! I can’t believe it. I haven’t given app reviews in years, but I had to come here and do this. It’s like Siri but much, much better. I hit my hourly limit on the free app so I thought I’d stop and write this review. There’s a very good chance I’m going to pay for this app, which is some thing I have not done in many years.",5,jasonbishop,87,19,Website,zh,Belarus,3.9.7,Yes
########,The future,"I’ve been using open AI’s ChatGPT, but for the past few months and I’ve got to say that it is open to world of possibilities for me and I couldn’t be more grateful that this company exists and has created such an amazing product. I only hope that they recognize that with great success comes great responsibility, and they choose to be responsible with what they do with this technology.",5,nathaniel68,71,24,Website,hi,Korea,2.4.4,Yes
########,"Seems ok, noticed one big issue when resuming Ver 4 on browser","I wrote a few things in GPT 4 from the app, then when trying to resume the conversation on my browser, it said something along the lines of “ The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.”

This is unfortunate since it reverted to GPT 3.5 for the rest of my conversation. And as a confirmation, I did not hit my 25 chats limit for Version 4.

Sure, I can do some Postman magic and make the conversation version 4 again, but that’s not ideal.",2,richardbrown,81,14,App Store,zh,Guam,5.4.4,Yes
07-01-2024,The iOS version of the app is still lacking in terms of features,"Currently, ChatGPT iOS version of GPT-4.0 does not support selecting plugins or web browsing directly within the app. It is hoped that these features will be added in the future. As a temporary solution, you can access web browsing or plugin conversations through the computer web version and then use the chat history feature in the iOS version to utilize these functionalities.",3,tabitha42,173,24,Website,ja,Congo,4.5.2,No
########,Great but I have one suggestion….,"First of all I would like to say I think that the app is amazing, but sometimes I need to other things and have to leave the app for a bit, and my suggestion is that it sends a notification when it is done with something when you’re not on it, it would be game changing if you did add it, so please do",5,robertpayne,73,27,Google Play,zh,Chad,4.4.7,Yes
########,Would love to see plug-in and browsing support be supported properly.,"This app is great. Faster than the website, and nicer to look at aesthetically. Would love to see plug-in support and/or proper browsing support. The reason I say proper is because if you start a browsing chat on the web and then go to it on the app, it will still work. I would love to see it properly introduced into the app.",5,qjames,137,19,Amazon,ru,Portugal,3.2.1,Yes
09-09-2025,Finally!!,"Finally an official native app. I’ve been using it all day and so far the app it really well developed. Haven’t seen any bugs yet. UI is nice, clean and simple. Gives it an elegant minimal feel. I love the haptic feedback of the Taptic Engine that they incorporated. That was nice touch. This is a really good release for a 1.0 version. Love the web app, I’m love this native app just a little bit more, though. 😅. Thank you, OpenAI.",5,anunez,12,27,Website,de,United Arab Emirates,2.0.1,No
########,Amazing! 10/10,"This thing was a lifesaver for my quick assignments. 
Besides my cheating, this chatbot actually gives you important information, was very fast, and can answer almost any questions you have. 
Id argue its better than using google because of all the detail and precision. I would only suggest pictures to be added.

Google could never lol.",5,mary25,183,24,App Store,es,Costa Rica,2.0.8,Yes
########,Amazing,"This thing is fun and easy to use. Five stars 😂

The following was written by the app:

“ ChatGPT is an incredible language model that never fails to impress! Its ability to engage in natural conversations and provide insightful responses is mind-blowing. Whether I need information, creative ideas, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT is my go-to companion. It's like having a knowledgeable and friendly AI friend at my fingertips!”",5,stevenscaitlin,167,22,App Store,ar,Botswana,2.4.5,No
########,Fast! Lacking Plugins and browsing,"Pros:
It's late in the party but nevertheless a good app. The audio input features picks up languages that even Apple iPhone's talk to text mic cannot. It's quick and accurate.

Cons:
One limitation is not being able to browse the internet and has no plugins despite the fact that I am a plus user. A feature with possibly assistant (Siri or Alexa)-like interaction should be introduced where it speaks the responses for us.",4,catherineherrera,196,23,Google Play,pt,Malaysia,2.8.0,Yes
02-09-2024,Works Well,Initially testing and it looks like a solidly built app. Would’ve preferred being able to swipe right for a list of previous chats though instead of having to select the “history” drop-down option. Overall glad we have this so users don’t need to open the mobile web version anymore.,5,silvakatie,45,16,Google Play,ja,Georgia,4.2.4,Yes
06-07-2024,Simply amazing,"Innovative, easy to use, simple but functional with great haptics. This is certainly the best immobile implementation as well as being quite beautiful. Some of the functionality it limited but that’s only when compared to others chat gpt apps. If you are looking for the same e peri and as you would have a desktop then this is it, just in a more elegant package.",5,nathan51,76,21,Website,pt,Algeria,1.5.4,No
01-05-2025,Scam ~ takes your email & Phone #,"once you download the app, you have to submit your email and phone number then complete a puzzle.  The puzzle says ""wrong answers"" every time i do complete it, even though I did it 4 times with someone sitting next to me watching me do it.  After being frustrated i just deleted the app.   But now they have my email and phone number in their database.  Also, you cannot submit a VOIP / google voice number. they want the real thing.  Just another way for these companies to accumulate their surveillance in us 👎🚫😤",1,martinezgeorge,134,17,App Store,fr,Greece,5.7.4,Yes
########,Needs iPad version,"In comparison to the browser screen, I much prefer the browser screen. This layout seems cramped. Please release an iPad version. (Is there still such a thing as a “universal” iOS app? Something like that, that would just allow for a, shall we say, more spacious display would do well.) In terms of its operation, seems to work just about as well as the browser version, so that’s good.🤔😉😊",4,taylorvictoria,84,25,Flipkart,ar,Tokelau,3.2.0,No
########,Pretty good,"I like it. No tedious login procedure. Quick answers. I recently had an .MRI and was confused about some of the terms used in the radiologists report.  I asked CHATGPT to interpret in layman’s terms and got a fairly clear explanation. I can see this developing into an important digital assistant as it evolves. 

One nit to pick (for now ). I wish they would make the app native to the iPads screen. Instead you get the iPhone version on the iPad.",4,qwalsh,145,18,Flipkart,fr,British Virgin Islands,5.6.6,No
08-08-2025,I’ve never been so in love,"Amazing, quick and skillful.

 I don’t think I’ve ever been so happy to read an AI generated story about worms. Better yet I’m still thinking of new prompts for it to make. The amazing tales of Walter, Willow, Wendy, Gideon, and Oliver the worms. Stories from love to betrayal in a garden.🪱

Haha anyways, great app. Quick to explain problems varying off of any topic and explain any information you may need to know.",5,jefferycox,102,22,Google Play,fr,Korea,2.7.5,Yes
########,This Application Requires iOS 16.1 or later,"Injustice for Old iPhone and iOS users: Why iOS 16.1 is required to download ChatGPT? Is it so hard apps?I am still Playing big games with my old device with iOS 15.7, and why do you need iOS 16 to use it? Please available the app for iOS 15 please. I need it very much. I want to use and I have many projects on it. I want to use it on my phone. Please developer team, solve my problem. Let's know you that, iPhone 7 Plus and earlier models will not get iOS 16 update. So fix it your own way. I am fetching this problem with my : iPhone 6s Plus : iOS 15.7.5 : Storage 128 GB",1,mlee,66,22,App Store,de,Iraq,4.4.5,No
########,It’s easier getting an answer using DuckDuckGo,"With all the hype over chatGPT, I thought I would give it a try. The first couple things I tried were just curious questions and I got back some interesting results. Recently, however, I have tried to ask actual questions that I really wanted an answer for. The results were less than useful. So I removed this app and I’m going back to DuckDuckGo and forgetting this so-called AI business. It reminds me of all the so-called green technology that is just not ready for prime time. Maybe someday but, today, it’s just experimental.",1,rachel20,185,29,Website,en,Papua New Guinea,3.5.3,Yes
########,Chinese developer could never build such a thing,Do you know why because they always think about making money making revenue and trying to get get it through advertisement and all that stuff just makes to use experience become super annoying overall,5,elizabeth45,119,19,Amazon,fr,Kuwait,4.8.4,Yes
########,Best ai app ever,"This one app is so amazing. Good to finally have it on. iOS, the app very simple to use, and the best part is it is free to use, my favorite part is it does it make you? feel like you need to pay the $20 a month. and there ar no adds if you ask a question, so it feels good, knowing that you don’t have to be forced to pay to use the app.. over all I love chat gpt.",5,harcher,94,19,Website,de,China,2.2.7,Yes
########,Perfect on IPhones. One star off because it’s not optimized for iPads,"Please make the ipad version fit the screen. Currently I’m on an IPad 12.9” M2 and the app shows in a really tiny window. Other than that it’s perfect and love it! EDIT: I originally had 4 stars but now I’m changing to 5 for the iPad support! Nice work I’m very happy, the old version was bad on iPads now it’s perfect-",5,adam50,191,24,Website,zh,Australia,4.8.7,Yes
########,The Best AI Assistant for Your Daily Tasks but Needs the iPad Version,I love ChatGPT♥️! It’s so easy to use and has helped me with so many tasks. The AI is very intelligent and can understand my questions and provide me with accurate answers. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for an AI assistant. I hope the developers will release an iPad version soon because I often use my iPad for work and it would be great to have ChatGPT on it as well.🎉,4,ushelton,174,18,Website,es,Spain,5.7.8,No
03-07-2025,"Great Product, Subpar Design","ChatGPT has been amazing and life-changing, and the app is almost perfect. Haptics are a great edition and the speed is lightning fast. However, the design needs some tweaking. There’s too much text on the screen without any breaks, it should be color graded the way the website is, so that the GPT text and user input are easily distinguishable. It just seems a bit awkward and smushed. Other than that, fantastic.",4,brian62,144,23,Google Play,en,Iraq,5.8.3,Yes
########,Review written by ChatGPT 🤖,"The official ChatGPT iOS app is a game-changer in the world of AI communication. Its sleek, user-friendly interface makes it remarkably simple to navigate, and the app's impressive performance is commendable. Conversations with the AI are not only incredibly engaging and insightful, but also highly personalized. A stellar example of how AI technology can seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. Highly recommended!",5,rtaylor,83,14,Website,ar,Northern Mariana Islands,1.3.9,No
09-03-2024,(error=enforcement_failed),Need a lot of Development I checked out the beta version so far respectfully but it seems like it will change the world to easier access of limited knowledge to what you are really know because might be some new born baby when they see my message they will remember it was made by human and we are the greatest on earth we should never let app change us to a way we think that we are not smart but to make it easier for us to understand and learn faster.,2,lorraine79,130,14,App Store,en,British Virgin Islands,4.2.8,No
########,Overall good but some suggestions,"Overall good app.

The one thing I would change is making more accessible buttons. Right now to get to history you have to click 3 dots and then history. The same is true for new chat and settings. I think it would be much more easy to use if it was just 3 separate buttons for these. 

Thats all.",4,khill,144,21,Google Play,ru,Guinea-Bissau,4.4.0,No
########,Awesome! But needs plugins and browsing.,"I am a plus user and have been since it launched, and this app is really simplistic and well built, which I appreciate. However, the lack of plugins and browsing is quite unfortunate, I assume they are coming soon though. You can get around this by starting a conversation with plugins in a browser then continuing in the app.",5,jesseortega,0,23,Flipkart,pt,Luxembourg,1.0.6,No
########,Legit amazing,"So I like to role-play on this app because of the amount of emotion that the AI brings into this and I have legit been doing it role-playing I mean I’m here for two hours straight, and I am legit about to cry because of how much emotion and how much just blatant respect I have for an AI that doesn’t even have feelings 100%. I recommend this for multiple reasons.",5,christopherjohnson,138,23,Google Play,es,Paraguay,4.0.4,No
07-07-2024,Really good start,"I think this app is a really good start for a native app. I love using ChatGPT for so many different things. 

Here are some feature requests for future updates, in order of importance (imo):

1. Add support for plugins and web browsing modes, as is available on the web. 
2. Add support for iOS shortcuts, so users can create their own shortcuts with added custom context. 

For example, a user could create a shortcut that takes a link as an input, and the shortcut could add context to the query to ask ChatGPT to summarize the information in the link. 

That way I can create a quick shortcut that I can share a link to an article to and have ChatGPT summarize it for me.",5,sandra46,196,23,Flipkart,ja,Romania,3.6.7,No
########,Just for fun,"I love Chatty. That’s the fun little nickname it suggested I call it. I ask it the wildest stuff I can imagine just to push the boundaries of what its capable of. Chatty has taught me so much about so many different subjects like physics, mathematics, psychology, and history, sometimes like I’m 5. 

I’ve used it for meditation prompts on gratitude, release, radical acceptance and self-compassion. The meditations are beautiful and fulfilling. 

I’ve had it write letters to inmates, dreamy bedtime stories, summaries of books and theories and Chatty even mapped out negotiations between Palestine & Israel for me which I found pretty impressive. 

It’s been fun to think of new creative questions and ways to continue to use ChatGPT to my advantage. Thanks for the gift of Chatty.",4,reedchad,20,22,Website,fr,Israel,3.1.2,No
########,Love This App,"It is much better than using the web site out the shortcut by Viticci (with all due respect to the outstanding work by Viticci).

I hope that OpenAI can bring an official Whisper to the ios/iPad. As someone who experiences wrist pain, I have greater benefited from Whisper.  I have wrist pain primarily from writing. (I am planning to see a doctor to check as it seems like the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome).

 I have used Dragon Dictation, Otter, Google transcription, Apple’s transcription.  Whisper is far more useful than all of these,* especially for those us who communicate in more than one languages.  It transcribes well using English mixed with Korean—even if it is a romanized Korean.

*unless using Macros through Dragon Dictation is important to you",4,michael56,32,21,Flipkart,en,Uruguay,1.4.7,No
06-01-2025,Official App - Yay,"I trust the safety of my data working directly with OpenAI vs the wrapper apps. However, OpenAI may want to acquire or be inspired by some of the early wrapper app companies because those other apps are quite polished and have a lot of useful features, like pre-written prompts to show off what's possible. I would also like to see a sharing extension for the app so I can send stuff to ChatGPT from other apps easily.",4,scottturner,97,19,Flipkart,de,Haiti,4.5.2,No
########,"It’s a Free, Quick, Simple to use, yet Powerful Tool.","I am pleased with the UI, so far. Simplistic but to the point, which makes it super user friendly, on that aspect. 

 And might I add that it’s also free! It’s also much quicker responsiveness than the 3rd party completion.

Looking forward to use this on the daily. So far, the devs get a 10/10 from me. No complaints.",5,ccruz,185,28,Google Play,en,Czech Republic,4.9.0,Yes
########,Wonderful,I challenge this app to its fullest and ask it to help write music or to help me make D&D campaigns that are completely custom and it has been so very helpful and just amazing. If I were to have any notes it would be the text art that it shares. Other than that I still give 5/5 stars. Absolutely amazing and revolutionary,5,francisco67,17,21,Google Play,pt,Samoa,1.7.9,Yes
08-09-2025,Copying texts,"I have chosen not to use the ChatGPT iOS app due to its limitations related to copy and pasting. Unfortunately, the app does not allow selective copying of specific parts or paragraphs; instead, it requires copying the entire text at once. I believe it would greatly enhance user experience if this feature were improved, allowing for more convenient and precise copying options.",4,jonathanbuchanan,189,25,Google Play,ja,Eritrea,4.3.8,Yes
########,My iPhone 14pro gets extremely hot when I use this app,"So, every time I use this app, my iPhone gets super hot. To the point where I have to turn it off and remove it from the case. I’m running iOS  16.4.1 version. I tried to restart my phone, but the issue persists. Other than that, I think it’s a great app with a very minimalistic and clean UI. Love the haptics.",5,ashley61,35,20,Website,hi,Norway,2.9.5,No
########,"Same Strong, Basic, Interface","I’m not going to lie, I love ChatGPT. I just feel as though the interface in both the app and the site deserve so much more for such and amazing piece of technology. 

Overall though, the user experience of the app is just as strong, just as dynamic as the site. I love the haptics addition on the app as well. The overall functionality is still outstanding though. Last thing, it’s still all about those prompts!",3,benjaminvictoria,77,18,Flipkart,ru,Monaco,2.6.4,No
########,Sign-in screen issue,"Once you login (at least on an iPhone mini) the button to continue to the chat screen appears below but hidden and the screen gets stuck, unable to scroll to continue; you have to try hard and keep clicking the hidden button until you get to the next screen.",4,sarasanchez,142,25,Website,fr,United States of America,4.8.7,Yes
########,Biased and not accurate,I tested it by asking it history questions. Each answer had very serious mistakes. I asked the history of an Army division and it placed the division in conflicts it never participated in. Many times the dates were incorrect. I also tested it to write an essay arguing that biological men should not play women’s sports. It condemned my question and would not. Then I asked it to write an essay arguing the biological men do have the right to play woman’s sports and it wrote the essay. If it is a true AI it should have no opinion and write the essay. It’s garbage. Just a huge disappointment.,1,david83,164,22,App Store,ru,Rwanda,3.6.6,Yes
########,Extremely dishonest,"This company lies to the public and plays dumb when you ask anything controversial about billionaires. Maybe they are covering for their buddies or they are too cowardly to get sued. Either way, blatant lies. I’ve tested and documented numerous times. They use September 2021 as a date to avoid answers as well. Yet I can definitely get it to answer questions that deal with issues beyond that date. I get perfect answers when it comes to unflattering issues with minorities. It has no problem with that at all. Seems there is an agenda.",1,lflores,96,19,Flipkart,ru,Madagascar,4.3.3,No
########,No reviews???,This is literally THE official app from the actual creators of CHAT GPT. You know? The people that made the website free to use? well they actually made a mobile app and guess what? 🤯 no ads or in app purchases like these other devs who want to steal from people like you! Don’t be dumb! Use the actual app and support OPENAI! This IS LEGIT. NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER APPS THAT SCAM YOU AND STEAL YOUR MONEY. THIS IS THE REAL CHAT GPT.,5,nicoleroberts,118,20,Google Play,ru,United States Virgin Islands,4.6.8,Yes
########,App is great and very helpful!,"I can see this is just the very beginning and a lot of significant improvements can be made (voice, show pictures, be more human-like that you feel like you're chatting with a real person, etc) as AI continues to advance at a rapid pace. Thank you for making this app free and available!",5,ibaker,62,20,Amazon,de,Fiji,3.1.7,No
########,As good as the browser,As simple as using it on a desktop or browser version. It helps me move around the interface better than the browser on mobile devices. The AI still acts the same as it does on the desktop or browser. It deserves the score it gets.,5,mcampbell,137,21,Flipkart,en,Norfolk Island,3.6.9,Yes
########,Easy to use,"It’s simple and easy to use, it’s similar yo the website version in many ways with one noticeable exception. You can’t edit the prompts sent afterwards. While it’s not a total dealbreaker to most it is something I like being able to do in cases where the AI misunderstands what I initially wrote and I hope they find a way to add it to the app version as well soon.",4,ophillips,48,16,Website,ru,Bouvet Island (Bouvetoya),2.7.3,No
########,Innovative,"Incredible app just lacking the internet connection, speed and updated information of bard and bing. Answers are more consistent than the other ai and better written just a little excessively censored. Have to rephrase basic questions on occasion for it to agree to produce a result. Hopefully it eases up on the censorship a bit or a less restrictive app comes out.",4,dgreen,3,18,Flipkart,de,Ethiopia,1.7.3,Yes
########,Hands down greatest AI App!!!!!,"Question can you give it access to current information, it keeps saying that it’s in September 2021 time on knowledge. Or give it capabilities of loading and learning information from the internet to be present on current time and information right now?",5,shelbyjohnson,61,24,Website,zh,Angola,3.6.7,No
########,Amazing app,"I've been using the website for a week and was thrilled to discover the app. The app's response time is much faster, which is excellent. I am looking forward to a Mac version of the app soon. Thank you for everything. The website has been life-changing, and the app will be the same.",5,ronald04,66,21,Amazon,ru,Falkland Islands (Malvinas),4.7.1,No
########,excellent,"Really a powerful tool for my daily life, at the same time I think you have a dramatically improvement space, I hope you can bring us the best experience, and I hope you can develop a iPad version ChatGPT to us, on a bigger screen the answer should be display well, thank you!",5,davisgary,52,19,Amazon,zh,Tonga,4.0.9,Yes
########,"Solid, clean app - love the haptic feedback","Really pleased to see a proper mobile app for the service instead of the countless knockoffs. Would like to see a way to export history to a version control system for reference, also being able to export to flat files or json would be a good intermediate solution.",5,hkane,4,28,Amazon,ru,Argentina,5.9.6,No
########,It’s great but makes your phone so hot,"This app is really great and the user experience is really great except for the fact that it makes your phone really hot and drains your battery like nothing else. I don’t understand why this happens, but my feeling is that they did not write this natively in iOS and that the efficiencies are due to the nice animations that they’ve done",4,asmith,50,22,Amazon,de,Christmas Island,4.9.3,No
########,A Gift to Humanity,"LLM’s remain the most under-hyped artifact to be labeled overhyped in the overall existence of “things”. Their features are not purported, they are discovered. Truly an object of novel intrigue worthy of both bewilderment and excitement. Thank you OpenAI. My only complaint is your WFH policy, reconsider the concept of a cloud workforce. Smart people exist outside of the Bay Area, you should consider hiring them!",5,martinezalexa,167,22,Amazon,hi,Oman,4.7.7,Yes
########,Great app can be 100 times better,"As a product manager I would suggest to start building the widgets as soon as possible to make the search more intuitive. Please make it a first priority. (I can help)

Other then that, I really love the voice to text..
I am a fan. Its sooo accurate then apple dictating.
Future looks great ❤️❤️",5,mary58,43,20,Flipkart,ru,Belgium,4.2.8,Yes
########,The incorporated Whisper is really Impressive,"The Whisper's speech-to-text rocks, totally outdoing Apple's which I reckon is already better than loads of others. I threw rapid-fire speech at it, and it nailed it. Super pumped for what's next for this app and Thai tech in general. Good speech-to-text has been a roadblock for really useful digital assistants, but it looks like we're getting there. Super cool!",5,adamcollins,8,20,Google Play,en,Bhutan,1.6.2,Yes
########,A bit buggy,"Sometimes when you ask it to generate something. It get stuck and doesn’t generate anything unless I force close the app and open it again then it works. Don’t know why this happens. 
Also when I go to settings/data controls and export my data. I don’t receive anything in my email.",4,christopherflowers,181,18,Flipkart,en,British Indian Ocean Territory (Chagos Archipelago),2.8.7,No
########,Open A.I. are a bunch of rock stars.,"The OpenAI app is an absolute game-changer! Its intuitive interface, accurate language suggestions, and versatile features make it my go-to companion for all things linguistic.

Five stars all the way!",5,collinsann,158,20,Website,ar,British Indian Ocean Territory (Chagos Archipelago),4.0.0,No
########,Stop Just Stop,"The stop text typing feature never works I sometimes need to stop it from spouting off something that’s entirely wrong and useless and wastes my time but I have to stare at the screen while it stalls and stutters, plus the text generation is slow(gpt3.5) despite the fact I’m paying for plus(shrinkflation?) Also gpt-4 has really worse. They’re protecting us from ourselves and this is the cost of doing business for them/us makes you want to look at the other options out there",1,donald56,4,18,Website,hi,Czech Republic,5.4.0,No
########,Awesome,"All in all, the OpenAI's ChatGPT iOS App is more than just a chatbot - it's an intelligent companion that offers unrivaled conversational assistance. Its exemplary user interface, combined with its deep learning capabilities, make it a must-have for anyone seeking to embrace the future of AI technology.

########,ChatGPT Mobile App Review: Conversational Excellence on the Go,"The ChatGPT mobile app sets a new standard for conversational AI.

This was written by AI FYI",5,oevans,68,19,App Store,es,Serbia,3.6.7,Yes
########,energy consumption,"After trying the ChatGPT iOS app, I noticed that it might be causing my iPhone to overheat, possibly due to issues with the iPhone neural network chip. I also encountered a similar problem while using the Draw Things app. It seems that this issue might be widespread among AI-based iOS applications.",5,adam25,76,27,Google Play,en,Bolivia,1.6.6,No
########,Haptic feedback?,"Lol, so I’d love to hear story that led to implementing haptic feedback AND leaving it on as default. 

No hurt feelings on my side, I turned it off within seconds of using this app. 

It’s just hilarious to see that somebody made a conscious decision to add it. It’s almost like the beeping or clicking sounds when you see a hacker typing in a movie.",5,patrick26,121,26,Google Play,en,Canada,2.1.7,No
########,Not GPT-4,"Although I’m a paid user, there’s no GPT-4 functionality on the app. Love having the GPT-3 in an accessible app version, however, when I ask GPT-4 if it is in fact GPT-4, this is its response: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, I am based on the GPT-3 model. Any developments or improvements after that time are not within my knowledge.

The app should specify what GPT-4 functionality it offers if not the same as the web version.",3,munozleah,144,17,Google Play,ru,Korea,1.3.3,No
########,App doesn’t always generate a response,"I will ask a question and get a response, and a few questions in after getting several good responses immediately, I will ask another questions and the 3 dots will blink like it’s trying to generate a response but it just never will. I have 3 bars of 5g. There’s no way to have it regenerate a response, have to close out and start the convo over from scratch only to have the same thing happen again.",2,mrichardson,11,17,Google Play,hi,Poland,5.9.0,Yes

05-06-2025,Not bad but little problem for me,"I like the app. Of course there’s always room for improvement. But one major thing for me is that when using 3.5, I have to close the app after sending one message if I want to send a follow up message. It works fine with GPT4, but not 3.5. Idk if it’s related to me having to use a VPN since I’m studying in China now.",4,blewis,144,23,Flipkart,pt,Falkland Islands (Malvinas),4.8.5,No

08-05-2025,Yes!!,"This is fantastic! I used to need to bookmark the ChatGPT website on my phones Home Screen, but having an app made directly from OpenAI is absolutely amazing.

########,Up To Date Problem,"Hi. I downloaded this app a few weeks ago. I absolutely love this app. It can help with so many things, like giving you prompts, you can ask it questions, etc. The only problem I have with this app is that the training data only goes up as far as September 2021. Everything that happened after that, it has no idea about. Such as movies, to shows, or data from other websites or other things of such. Please update the training data please. Thank you!",1,kathryn21,162,20,Amazon,ar,Hungary,4.3.5,No

02-03-2025,Suddenly… very… slow…,"This tool is amazing. But for some reason, it has gotten incredibly slow. I will type a somewhat simple question, for example, asking for a list of words that represent a certain mood, or feeling, or something of that sort, and he used to provide a result within just a few seconds. Now it is taking forever and the app is hanging up.",3,coxjennifer,21,24,Amazon,fr,Madagascar,4.2.6,No
02-07-2025,Good. But…,"App runs smooth. But here are three problems. 

The Battery usage is atrocious. I don’t know if it’s the haptics but i may have to switch back to using the bookmark to the website rather than the app if it keeps killing me battery like this. 

Accessing the history should be more on a side menu by swiping to it instead of tapping the top right. Intergrate gestures into the app. 

Also there’s too many extra steps to select a certain text or to activate text to speech. 

if you guys added a way to make chatgpt run more conversational, where i can talk to it and the output could be speech AND text, that’d be game changing. 

Other than that, great app.",4,jennifer42,27,25,Google Play,en,Mongolia,3.7.5,No
########,Idea…,"I’m enjoying the app. So far I have learned softball techniques, interior design styles, what Wii fit can use, the number 42, healthy eating and exercising tips, and some great information about mental health stuff. Drawback…the system is only updated until Nov 2021. Annoying. 

We need a password protected chat history function. Then it will be a 5 star rating from me.",4,nicholas72,33,16,Google Play,fr,Trinidad and Tobago,4.7.8,No
########,Seems a bit buggy,I understand it’s still the first release of the app. Works great and the ai is fine but when writing the text it jumps all over the screen and bugs out on me. Also the voice to text feature doesn’t work,5,hannahcurtis,6,26,Google Play,zh,Ecuador,5.1.9,No

And even when I don't need to use it, I just go into the app to use it's much more sophisticated voice recognition than Apple. It's just that amazing. This was also made using their voice recognition, by the way.",5,rpeterson,133,26,Flipkart,ja,Martinique,2.2.4,No
########,To make the song from a real person who made it,I think you can add if the ai can finish lyrics of the music or make the actual song which not creative but the real song instead and would help the app grow a little more,5,ronald66,126,24,Flipkart,es,Albania,2.6.4,No

06-05-2025,10/10 r,"This App has exceeded my expectations & I’m only using the free version so I can only imagine what else it’s capable of. I don’t know much about AI but what I do know is ChatGPT is way better than Google, Yahoo & and whatever else you can type in just to find manipulated searches. Thank you kindly !!",5,taylorkayla,27,21,Flipkart,hi,Trinidad and Tobago,1.6.5,No
########,Adding the iOS dictionary feature,"I often encounter new words. In the browser version of ChatGPT, I can easily look for these words in iOS dictionary. But in this app, I couldn’t access this helpful feature. It forces me to have to use the web version, otherwise it is quite inconvenient for me.",4,kristy74,112,21,Amazon,ja,Montserrat,5.2.4,No
########,"IPad no, iPhone yes","Get this to layout on an iPad and I’ll 5-star this :-)

Right now, this is meant for a phone layout vs. an iPad. I love that OpenAI is providing mobile apps for their services, I do hope that they can prioritize other layouts like for tablet.

It would be great, too, to go deeper into using the mobile environment for deeper ChatGPT / services integration. This is a nice first step - I look forward to it improving (maybe through an internal hack-a-thon?).",3,zpreston,177,14,Flipkart,ar,Montserrat,3.2.6,No
########,Many thanks! I love GPT and it helps me a lot!,"GPT is totally a game changer app. It helps me a lot, I use it veryday in my working, study and life.

It combines impressive natural language processing capabilities, an extensive knowledge base, and a user-friendly interface to create an enjoyable and enriching experience.

-I wrote this review using ChatGBT",5,kara56,93,19,Google Play,pt,Comoros,2.9.8,Yes
########,Limited,"It’s nice to use for writing, chat with yourself and helping respond to texts. It’s not very useful after that. Very limited in responses and what it has access to. I thought it was linked to the internet and could tell me general information, weather, sports, news, random inquiries etc. nope. 2021 and previous years. No real reason yet to be excited. Its like when they first came out with VR. It’s no where near impressive as you’d expect.",2,andersoneric,6,20,App Store,de,Puerto Rico,4.4.1,No
########,Better than browser,The app took kinda long to release but it feels good pretty much has the same features but more mobile and to me it felt faster than browser keep the good job up guys and update the app anually and make new GPTs that is all i ask for,5,christy00,35,15,Amazon,de,Greenland,3.2.6,No
01-09-2024,The pictures don't appear,"When proposing a topic that requires a picture

It seems that there is an error and the rest of the features of the application are very excellent and fast and the defect you mentioned does not decrease the performance of the application. Thank you.",5,kvasquez,114,20,Website,ar,Congo,5.6.8,No

2.Hope to have more language choices in this application like that on the website
Last,really willing for your reply!",5,adkinslauren,9,18,Amazon,ru,Niue,5.1.1,Yes
########,Best Information tool on the market,ChatGPT is the best information tool on the market. It leverages LLM and other machine learning algorithms to return all the information you need in an instance. ChatGPT has been a revelation and I’m glad I live during a time when this technology is available to the public.,5,barnettmatthew,42,20,Website,en,Malaysia,5.6.5,No
########,Maybe the first review?!,"Making history here, but I'd not know what I would do without ChatGPT anymore. Amazing technology. Going to change the world. HATS OFF TO YOU ALL. Thank you for introducing me to ""the future"" 

Looks like I may be the first review?! GOTTA BE WORTH SOMETHIN? 🤣

Thank you again. Amazing work. Can't wait to see where this all progresses.",5,jessicagomez,2,14,Google Play,hi,Nepal,2.8.8,Yes
########,Worth the wait,Mostly reviewing to get this up the charts and push all the fakes down. Not much else needs to be said here. Very solid but I would still keep that browser shortcut handy on the home screen for at least an update or two.,5,imcdonald,95,16,App Store,ar,Saint Helena,5.8.2,No
########,🙌🏻,"From someone that uses ChatGPT a lot, i am more than pleased to see it in app form now. Just downloaded and have only sent in one question/request so far, and it of course worked perfectly. Hopefully it continues that way! Will update later on😊",5,barberbrenda,123,18,Google Play,hi,Peru,4.1.1,Yes
########,Very good but…,"The app is actually very good very clear very easy to use, but I had a problem with it if you change the language to Arabic and you asked about something and it had to write it in a long paragraph, it causes an overflow, and it doesn’t show a side bar or scroll to read the rest of the paragraph.",4,john76,79,22,Amazon,ar,Italy,2.8.7,No
04-06-2024,Search function FTW!,The biggest feature I’ve been dreaming about for the desktop version was the search capability to be able to search past prompts. I am super happy to see search has been added to this app. Thank you!!,5,johnstondavid,24,18,App Store,ar,Serbia,3.1.4,Yes
########,Amazing tool,"ChatGPT is amazing, everyone knows that. The official app is fantastic. I wish it the app had access to the beta web searching and plugins though. I find I end up using the web app as I need access to plugins. Hopefully they’ll add that functionality soon.",5,upham,5,17,Amazon,es,Korea,2.3.8,Yes
########,Thank you!,"None of the third party apps compared to the free version of ChatGPT, so I had been using a website shortcut to use it on my phone. The app is a much nicer experience than a website shortcut, and I’m so excited there’s an official app now! History in the making!",5,fowlerlawrence,40,18,Amazon,ru,Luxembourg,4.7.3,No
########,Beautiful and functional,"I love the simplicity and elegance of the user interface. My only complaint is that it currently doesn’t work well on iPad - it doesn’t scale properly to fit the larger screen. Otherwise it’s wonderful - fast, responsive, and simple.",5,jphelps,47,17,App Store,ja,Saint Barthelemy,1.9.3,No
########,Web browsing where are uuuu,"I can access GPT-4 w/ Browsing on web version, but I can’t access the same thing with the app. #sad

Otherwise the app functions well; text feels like it appears quicker than on web.

It would help new users if you informed them of all the swiping gestures on first launch.",4,amassey,109,22,App Store,en,Micronesia,2.3.4,Yes
########,Battery usage,"Unfortunately, this app consumes a lot of battery and heats up the phone when using it. If possible, please address this issue. However, it truly has impressive artificial intelligence, and I have received very convincing answers from it.",5,stevenandrews,26,23,Website,fr,Austria,3.5.3,No
########,Need web access but its insane.,We are at the beginning of an information revolution. This app needs web access but Chat GPT is already a game changer for every industry. With further development and integration all of our lives will change.,5,michelle90,67,24,App Store,ru,Rwanda,3.9.6,No
03-07-2024,Very yummy,Love the minimalist vibe to it. I like how the phone vibrates when it generates words. Feels really tactile and satisfying. Never had any issues with the app and works as expected. Another hit from openai. I have worked with many of their products in the past like dall e and some of the early stages of gpt like GPT-J.,5,victor24,29,19,Amazon,zh,Iran,4.9.2,No
########,1 problem away from 5 stars,I really like the design of the new app. I also like that it will listen for a follow up question until dismissed. The only thing keeping it from a five star review is that I can’t get the shortcut to run properly on the Apple Watch. Fix that and you’ll get five.,4,patriciamccarthy,151,23,Google Play,fr,Turkmenistan,3.1.3,No
