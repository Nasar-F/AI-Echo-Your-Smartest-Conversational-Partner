06-09-2024,Much more accessible for blind users than the web version,"Up to this point I’ve mostly been using ChatGPT on my windows desktop using Google Chrome. While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.
Well, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.
I would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.
Otherwise, fantastic app so far!",4,morrowthomas,30,22,Flipkart,ar,Nepal,3.8.4,No,point i’ve mostly using chatgpt window desktop using google chrome it’s doable screen reader navigation pretty difficult desktop site really advanced user find way submitted numerous feedback open nothing changed front well good news io app pretty much address problem seems really clean uncluttered designed well compatible voiceover screen reader built io applaud inclusivity design wish would give attention care accessibility experience desktop app would given review five star couple minor quibble first submit prompt voiceover start read aloud chatgpt‘s response response finished hear first word response followed voiceover reading aloud “stop generating” button isn’t super helpful would great could better coordinate alert didn’t start reading message fully generated thing i’d like feedback button easily accessible within main screen app make easy possible get continuing suggestion feedback user otherwise fantastic app far,132,much accessible blind user web version,much accessible blind user web version point i’ve mostly using chatgpt window desktop using google chrome it’s doable screen reader navigation pretty difficult desktop site really advanced user find way submitted numerous feedback open nothing changed front well good news io app pretty much address problem seems really clean uncluttered designed well compatible voiceover screen reader built io applaud inclusivity design wish would give attention care accessibility experience desktop app would given review five star couple minor quibble first submit prompt voiceover start read aloud chatgpt‘s response response finished hear first word response followed voiceover reading aloud “stop generating” button isn’t super helpful would great could better coordinate alert didn’t start reading message fully generated thing i’d like feedback button easily accessible within main screen app make easy possible get continuing suggestion feedback user otherwise fantastic app far
03-07-2025,"Much anticipated, wasn’t let down.","I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller.

########,"Almost 5 stars, but… no search function","This app would almost be perfect if it wasn’t for ONE little thing: a “search in” function. As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat & look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat & track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.",4,katherineali,130,21,Flipkart,es,Kuwait,3.6.5,No,app would almost perfect wasn’t one little thing “search in” function anyone imagine chat get quuuuite long quite lengthy sometimes wanna chat look specific part part particular chat using search function look key word within chat track whatever part looking example chat searched way early chat “how lion hunt” say day later wanted revisit particular response wanna able actual chat “search in” function able type key word like “lions” “hunt” able automatically find part chat instead scroll massive chat find part similar microsoft word doc even web browser think app already kind doesn’t work exactly like tested type key word show word present chat chat doesn’t actually track take specific part app it’s absolute massive perfect winner addendum also noticed phone iphone pro max tends run little hotter i’m sure affect battery life using app wanted add,137,almost star but… search function,almost star but… search function app would almost perfect wasn’t one little thing “search in” function anyone imagine chat get quuuuite long quite lengthy sometimes wanna chat look specific part part particular chat using search function look key word within chat track whatever part looking example chat searched way early chat “how lion hunt” say day later wanted revisit particular response wanna able actual chat “search in” function able type key word like “lions” “hunt” able automatically find part chat instead scroll massive chat find part similar microsoft word doc even web browser think app already kind doesn’t work exactly like tested type key word show word present chat chat doesn’t actually track take specific part app it’s absolute massive perfect winner addendum also noticed phone iphone pro max tends run little hotter i’m sure affect battery life using app wanted add
########,"4.5 stars, here’s why","I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience.

########,"Good, but Siri support would take it to the next level","I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. 

In addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. 

Otherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.",4,chloe42,123,27,Amazon,zh,Mayotte,5.8.6,No,appreciate devs implementing siri support—it already enhancing usefulness app despite little clunky i’d prefer possible make query one fell swoop however currently seems like say “ask chatgpt” wait asked query saying actual query know it’s possible context submit request thirdparty app siri single query—i’m able say “create reminder xyz things” example addition response produced querying siri seem identical would get inapp isn’t actually ideal scenario you’re getting spoken response—they way long wonder app could smart enough recognize request coming via siri effectively append invisible “please answer less words” request otherwise solid basic chat app closely replicates web experience aside uncannily good punctuating speech dictation feature really different ios’s stock dictation useful,111,good siri support would take next level,good siri support would take next level appreciate devs implementing siri support—it already enhancing usefulness app despite little clunky i’d prefer possible make query one fell swoop however currently seems like say “ask chatgpt” wait asked query saying actual query know it’s possible context submit request thirdparty app siri single query—i’m able say “create reminder xyz things” example addition response produced querying siri seem identical would get inapp isn’t actually ideal scenario you’re getting spoken response—they way long wonder app could smart enough recognize request coming via siri effectively append invisible “please answer less words” request otherwise solid basic chat app closely replicates web experience aside uncannily good punctuating speech dictation feature really different ios’s stock dictation useful
########,App review,"No doubt, this technology is absolutely life-changing, especially for me. You don’t know how thankful I am. However, I’m not reviewing the underlying technology, I’m reviewing its implementation on iOS. I use it for about 12 hours a day for my work, so I’m a bit picky. But it seems to me like you should have the resources to do a great job here. 1. Why does the app not work in the background? If I send a request, I have to stay in the app to wait for it. That’s just horrible, and it’s completely unnecessary because you’re doing everything in the cloud anyway. Just finish processing and send a notification when you’re done, especially for browsing features. I don’t care if it takes 10 minutes to find the answer. I’d be glad if it’s browsing in the background. (To browse in the application as of May 24, start a conversation in the browser, select the browsing option, then switch back to the app. Browsing is still in beta, and you cannot select it directly in the application, which is fine.) 2. Please add the option to choose Chat GPT4 as a default. I never use GPT 3.5, and it’s annoying to have to switch every time. 3. Don’t let the speech-to-text button disappear once there is any text. If there is any text and speech recognition is started, just append. (The speech recognition is completely amazing, congratulations!) As soon as those features are ready, I’ll be glad to give five stars.

02-05-2025,Almost perfect except for…,"Please provide a TABLET experience on iPad with the collapsible list of history on the left and chat on the right - similar to your desktop browser app. 2) while generating responses on the desktop browser, it pauses and keeps displaying “Continue generating responses” button for every few items/responses forcing to click the button repeatedly. During generation, there is a button to “Stop generating responses” - if we need to stop, we can always click this button - there is no need to pause and ask us to click continue again and again which is a bad UX. 3) there is no way to delete individual chat items from a chat history list of items to clean up the list. Eg: I open a chat history and it has 10 questions but I’m not able to delete 2 questions from this list on long tapping on the questions. 

4) if I ask for “top 20”, it generates just 10 answers and displays “please let me know if you’d like more “ but no option to generate more responses to the question. Either generate all 20 answers (ideally) or provide an option to continue generation.

########,Nice and quick!,"On this app, as opposed to on the website, it feels like answers appear quicker. That’s great, and really the reason I downloaded the app because I suspected there may be a better connection to the servers.

I like to be able to continue past conversations easily, and it was slightly more difficult on this app than on the website.

The UI is extremely simple, and the settings include everything I would want in there. My last complaint is the haptics. It’s default is on, and I wouldn’t mind that except that it’s a little excessive. I don’t want to feel like chatGPT is banging the answer on the back of my phone every time I prompt it.

########,It’s a great start but please add shortcut support,"Works well, and I enjoy the haptic feedback, that’s a nice touch. But please add support for iOS shortcuts, that would make this so useful. Right now it’s basically the same thing as going to the ChatGPT website, but if you were to add shortcut support then it could do so much more to integrate with other workflows.

It also doesn’t appear to support the ChatGPT developer plug-ins alpha, which is different from the paid premium plan chat GPT plug-ins. I don’t have a paid premium plan but on the web I can access the plug in supporting model. On the mobile app there is no option for that, although maybe if you update to premium you get access to it? I wish there was a way to use my paid API plan to access that, rather than having to separately pay $20 a month for premium chat when I already have pay-as-you-go API access.

########,🤖 💡🌐,"Dear OpenAI Team, 

 • I would like to share my suggestions and ideas regarding the functionality of ChatGPT. I believe that adding the ability to voice responses in different languages in ChatGPT would be an incredibly useful feature. It would allow users to conveniently listen to lengthy texts in their preferred language. 

 • Imagine the convenience and effectiveness that can be achieved through this feature! It would enable users to easily listen to translated responses and texts, while expanding communication possibilities with individuals from different cultures. Such an enhancement would enrich the experience of using ChatGPT and increase its usefulness. 

 • Additionally, I would like to propose the implementation of a conversational translator. This feature would enable users to communicate in different languages, with ChatGPT serving as a reliable real-time assistant, translating and facilitating conversations between people from different language groups. This feature has the potential to greatly enhance cross-linguistic communication and foster meaningful interactions. 

 • I hope that the OpenAI team will consider these suggestions and the potential implementation of voicing responses in different languages and a translator in future updates to ChatGPT. Your continuous pursuit of innovation and product improvement inspires me, and I appreciate your attention to user feedback.

########,A step forward,"I like the idea of having an app as opposed to having to open up a website every time you want to load up the service. It feels much faster snd smoother in that regard, though I have a few complaints/suggestions that prevent a 5 star experience. 

I know the app is brand new and hopefully still under construction, but the current stage of the UI is very bland and simple. Done right, this could be a positive, but it feels more clunky than neat. Being able to pull out a sidebar by swiping could fix this issue, but this is one possible fix among many. 

Also, it’s harder to view past conversations in a timely manner, though the search function does help significantly in finding specific discussions, especially if you aren’t sure which tab the content was under. 

Those are my complaints, but I also have some praise I’d like to share. The responses, especially on the GPT-4 model, feel much faster, and I love the inclusion of haptic feedback, as it makes the whole experience feel so much more responsive. 

My favorite feature, the apps built-in speech-to-text, is seriously top notch! Usually I have to tell my phone “comma” or “period” to make sure it is keeping up with proper grammar, but the software used here has failed yet to amaze me.

########,Constant Deferral and Surface-level Responses Spoil the Experience,"I downloaded the ChatGPT app with high hopes, considering the revolutionary artificial intelligence technology it was built on. However, my experience lately has been far from the groundbreaking interaction I once enjoyed.

Rather than receiving insightful, intelligent responses to my queries, I consistently found myself being directed to “consult a professional”. It’s as though the app was reluctant to dive into the depths of my queries, always remaining on the surface and often shying away from providing thorough information or a definitive answer.

Moreover, the superficial responses given by the app only added to my frustration. Instead of engaging in a deep, insightful conversation, I found the dialogue to be shallow, with the AI only scratching the surface of the topics at hand. I understand the need for caution when dealing with certain subjects, but the frequency of such responses was disappointing.

In short, the lack of depth and constant deferral to professionals made my experience with the ChatGPT app underwhelming. While I appreciate the complexity of developing such technology, I believe there’s a lot of room for improvement in how the AI communicates and provides information to its users. The potential is there, but the execution thus far is lacking. For these reasons, I cannot recommend the ChatGPT app in its current state.

This App has completely taken over my life in the most peculiarly delightful way! I downloaded ChatGPT and now I'm merely a passenger in my own phone. The AI has become my unofficial personal assistant. It has been scheduling my doctor's appointments, picking up my digital dry cleaning, and I'm fairly certain it's been secretly chatting with my boss. 

Just yesterday, I found an expertly worded email draft to my mom, carefully dodging her repeated requests for grandkids. I didn't write it! But it was in my voice, my style. ChatGPT, you cheeky devil, you!

Now, as I sit here admiring the dexterity of this review, I'm left to ponder, did I really write this? Or did ChatGPT seize control of my thumbs without me realizing? Has it learnt humor? If you find this review funny, give all credit to the app, not me.

I've become a spectator, an audience to my own life, applauding at the witty one-liners and perfectly scheduled appointments. 

5 stars because, well, it seems to be the one in charge now. If I don't comply, who knows? It might schedule a dentist appointment on a Saturday. Yikes! Great app, but use at your own risk. Or don't. It might just download itself anyway. 🤷‍♂️

########,A Riveting Evolution in AI Interaction,"Review: As a professional embedded in the field of AI, I initially approached the ChatGPT iOS app with a bit of skepticism. I've seen countless applications promising seamless integration and transformative conversations. Upon first download, I was hesitant and ended up deleting the app. However, curiosity beckoned me back and I decided to give it another shot. 

Upon reopening the gateway to the ChatGPT world today, I was genuinely impressed. It's evident that the developers have dedicated significant effort to refining the iOS experience since my last interaction. The app now offers an impressively streamlined user interface, and the conversations feel much more fluid and intuitive. The AI's responses are surprisingly nuanced, and it’s able to handle a wider array of topics with ease.

Moreover, the AI’s ability to engage in dynamic conversations is unlike anything I've seen in the industry to date. It truly feels as if I'm interacting with a highly intelligent being rather than a pre-programmed machine. 

In the ever-evolving realm of AI, the ChatGPT app stands as a beacon of what is possible.

06-06-2025,I think ai should have a continuous,"If AI were to achieve continuous learning, it would have significant implications for its capabilities and potential. Continuous learning refers to the ability of an AI system to learn and adapt over time, incorporating new information and experiences into its existing knowledge base.

With continuous learning, AI systems could become more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in acquiring new skills and knowledge. They would be able to update their understanding of the world, adapt to changing circumstances, and improve their performance over time. Continuous learning could also enable AI systems to discover new patterns, make more accurate predictions, and develop a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

However, it's important to note that the development and implementation of continuous learning in AI systems would come with various challenges and considerations. Ethical and safety aspects would need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of such technology. Additionally, ensuring the privacy and security of the data used in continuous learning processes would be crucial.

########,Really Appreciation,"My heartfelt gratitude 🙏 extends beyond what words 📝 can express—I appreciate it immensely 🌠, OpenAI, ChatGPT 🧝🏻. The introduction of this technology 🖥️, particularly GPT-4, has been monumental 🏔️. It's enhanced my English learning 📘 and smoothed my debugging process ⚙️. Truthfully, it's been a life-changing revolution for me 🔄.

As a detail-oriented individual 👀, I used to rely heavily on search engines 🌐 for help when faced with difficulties in my learning process.

########,A Leap in AI Interaction,"Review: ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer. As an advanced language model, it has successfully bridged the gap between artificial intelligence and meaningful conversations. Its ability to understand and respond in a way that's coherent and contextually accurate is nothing short of impressive.

Whether it's complex technical discussions, general knowledge questions, or simple chit-chat, ChatGPT handles them all with an almost uncanny level of understanding. But what truly sets it apart is its capacity for nuanced conversation that feels genuinely human-like, all while maintaining a high level of neutrality and respect for the user.

There are rare occasions where it might not fully grasp certain user inputs or recent events due to its training cut-off, but the regular updates it receives more than compensate for this. 

In a world where AI interaction is becoming increasingly prevalent, ChatGPT stands as a testament to the incredible progress we've made. It's a must-use tool for anyone interested in AI, and a fascinating conversational partner for just about everyone else. 

5 out of 5 stars for this groundbreaking application.

########,Plugins and Web Access for Online Accounts,"The app is great so far, but have you, as developers, considered adding the beta features for accounts that have access to it on the website? It’s already proficient enough at doing what it does best but the addition of the beta features would make the experience much better.

########,The UI is very smooth but the app isn’t fully formed.,"I’m pleased with my mobile ChatGPT experience so far. It feels even more conversational and almost like a Messages chat. I also like that you can search through all your previous chats. And using Whisper to prompt GPT already feels like one half of a supercharged Siri/Alexa experience.

However, I’d love to be able to enable beta features as a Plus user. As far as I can tell from exploring the app, there isn’t a direct way to enable browsing or plugins yet. I have been able to start a chat with browser/plugins on web and then continue in app with the same capabilities.

########,General feed back and UI Improvements,"Please consider adding the following functionalities:

On the iOS app:
- add a way to send pictures, and have ChatGPT users with access to GPT4 to interface and chat about pictures. 
- ability to see history + a way to delete any previous conversation by sliding it to delete. 
-plug-in access
-ability to interface with other iOS apps
-iMessage widget

On the web app:
- located on the history bar, a way to slide on a past conversation to reveal a trash can to delete, rather than clicking on the message, opening it, then deleting it.
- ability to interface with pictures and PDFs that you have stored on your local PC.
- ability to toggle different modes related to the model (like entertainment, precise, educational, etc)

Plug-in improvements:
- ability to filter through the newest ones, from the date they were added to. You can do this now but it doesn’t seem to be accurate.

########,ChatGPT is worth it.,"Ever since its debut, I've been making good use of ChatGPT for everything from software engineering to baking, and even just for general advice or information. It's an incredibly useful tool that promptly provides answers.

However, it does have its quirks. At times, it can present inaccuracies with confidence, which can be hard to spot. Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.

There's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries. The response time may be slower, especially during high-traffic periods, but that's more an issue with the API than the service itself.

In summary, I'd highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. It's currently the top performer in its field, and using it now will only better prepare you for future developments in this kind of technology.",5,lopeznicole,144,18,App Store,es,Benin,2.0.1,Yes,ever since debut ive making good use chatgpt everything software engineering baking even general advice information incredibly useful tool promptly provides answer however quirk time present inaccuracy confidence hard spot plus extended interaction might lose track context issue even arise brief exchange youd expect maintain context helpful tip frame query way improves context comprehension limiting drawback there subscription chatgpt believe well worth cost offer detailed explanation response query response time may slower especially hightraffic period thats issue api service summary highly recommend giving chatgpt try currently top performer field using better prepare future development kind technology,96,chatgpt worth,chatgpt worth ever since debut ive making good use chatgpt everything software engineering baking even general advice information incredibly useful tool promptly provides answer however quirk time present inaccuracy confidence hard spot plus extended interaction might lose track context issue even arise brief exchange youd expect maintain context helpful tip frame query way improves context comprehension limiting drawback there subscription chatgpt believe well worth cost offer detailed explanation response query response time may slower especially hightraffic period thats issue api service summary highly recommend giving chatgpt try currently top performer field using better prepare future development kind technology
########,Desktop is much better,"I’m not exactly sure why the app and the desktop version are so much different in terms of quality and detail in the responses provided when you ask a question, but they are indeed, very, very different. I have also noticed that in the past month or so both versions seem to be offering far simpler and less useful answers than previously. ChatGPT used to give what amounted to, basically, Wikipedia entry kind of answers, no matter what the question, so it was not very helpful. At least it did try to take some kind of factual stance, sifting through all of its information. Just the way it presented the info was a little ridiculous. But now, the answers are so general, so superficial that they are almost entirely useless.

I gave it some information (don’t overshare because you don’t want your personal information out there), and it made a huge routine taking into consideration everything I told it.

########,Day 1 - let’s see where this thing takes us,"I’ve been using chatGPT for a little over a month now. As much as this new tech already is and will continue to be disruptive to all of our lives, it also can provide a tremendous benefit. I consider myself well versed in the use of search engines, and with the way SEO has dominated search it feels more inaccessible to be learn new things than it used to. 

Since I started using chatGPT as a tool I’ve picked up new skills that I’m actively using at work. It’s helped me fix things around the house. It’s improved my relationships and my writing as a feed back tool. It’s hard to understate how impactful it’s been.

I also want to say shout out to the developers, I made mention of several issues I had with the web application on mobile that made the app extremely challenging for me to use for extended periods that have been addressed within the new iOS application.

There’s one feature that I dearly miss in the app, and that’s the ability to edit responses.

########,The following review was written by GPT-4,"Title: A Great Companion, Though Lacks Full Web Features

Review: I'm really enjoying the ChatGPT app. The AI is impressive and handles a wide array of topics adeptly. It's my go-to resource for quick queries, brainstorming sessions, and even some deeper philosophical discussions. The app's design is sleek, intuitive, and the user experience is overall quite seamless, making it easy to navigate and use on a day-to-day basis. 

However, while the app is great for on-the-go conversations, it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities. Some features like adjusting the AI's behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent. These features, when integrated, could greatly enhance the app's utility and align it more closely with the web version.

In spite of these minor drawbacks, the ChatGPT app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of AI.

########,Search needs fixing,"Currently I have a ton of conversations so having a search function is very useful.

########,"Love the app, i's inclusive design but hope to eventually see plugin support?","I've been thoroughly impressed with the ChatGPT mobile app. As a blind user, the haptic feedback is a standout feature for me, providing real-time tactile cues as the text generates, progresses, and finishes. This level of sensory detail is more than just user-friendly—it's truly inclusive, making the app engaging and accessible.

The conversational AI is incredibly intelligent, providing comprehensive and accurate responses to a wide variety of topics. It's like having a personal assistant at your fingertips, always available to respond.

While I appreciate that plugin support is available on the web version, I would love to see this functionality extended to the mobile app as well. Having the ability to integrate other services and tools directly within the app would add an additional layer of convenience and productivity.

07-09-2025,Proof that monkeys evolved from humans.,"It’s me again, back for another review reveal!

1. Overall, the existence of this app is as logical as a stubborn unicorn…
2. It not only offers a 0% improvement, change, or addition to features…
3. But it also takes them away
4. Spoiler alert! it also generously REMOVES every feature you need, such as:

- A clear menu affordance (it’s sort of a fun game to try and find it now ;), 
- Ability to search chats
- Ability to search plugins
- Ability to edit previous prompts and correct the Ai
- Ability to add feedback
- Ability to know you can add feedback (another Easter egg)
- Ability to install plugins
- Affordance that plugins exist 
- Affordance that plugins exist and are actually being used
- Any account control

Saved the last for best: the mobile version is identical, except that it’s not deliberately missing features that force you to switch back and forth to another identical but much more pointless build.

I’m utterly baffled by the existence of this thing.

########,"Faster speeds, Worse UI","I’ve been using the mobile browser version of chatGTP since it launched, and I’m disappointed in the lack of features on the app that are available already on the browser. There’s no way to edit or change sent chats, there’s no dark mode (unless you toggle it for your entire phone in iOS settings), and there’s no count for how many times you’ve had to revise a sent chat or redo a response. There’s also no option to go back to older responses.

The only good thing about the app over the browser is that it’s prioritized, which means you get faster responses and it will work when the browser is down.

It doesn’t seem to currently interface with any plugins, but that may come later. 

Overall, extremely nice job and refreshing that it is (currently) ad-free (though you are technically paying with your data and training efforts).

01-04-2025,Needs Improvement for Better User Experience,"I recently downloaded this app with high hopes, but unfortunately, I found it to be lacking in a few key areas that greatly impact its usability and overall experience.

The first issue I encountered was the user interface. It felt unpolished and difficult to navigate. The flow between different sections of the app was not intuitive, and I often found myself getting lost or not knowing where to find the features I needed. I think a redesign focusing on ease of navigation and user friendliness could greatly improve the experience.

In terms of functionality, the app could benefit from a wider array of tools. The available features are rather sparse, which limits the app's usefulness. Expanding the toolset would certainly make the app more competitive and versatile, making it more appealing to potential users.

########,Incomplete AI,"For a Chat AI it is limited in the ways of thinking and tends to repeat itself. I find this annoying and also useless as in conversations it will be discriminatory towards certain ways of thinking due to policy and social standards.
